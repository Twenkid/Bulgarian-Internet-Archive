See http://www.ehow.com/how_5805520_use-freeze-damage-fruit-trees.html for example which recommends a sprinkler. The releases heat thing is kind of an oversimplification, but basically as long as you have any liquid water around, it will keep things at zero. The sap of your tree is not pure water, and therefore freezes somewhat below zero. By having the water freeze instead you stay away from the temps that would damage your plants. That said, http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5245655_spraying-frost-protect-fruit-freezing_.html is total gibberish since evaporation doesnt generate heat, quite the opposite.

I know one who was the runt of her litter and has been extremely thin all her life, to the point where you can easily count every bone. She is now 17 years old, having outlived two other cats in that household, so it certainly doesnt seem to have held her back.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.0 \t\t Yes. Just like us, cats vary in size and shape and weight. And like us, some of that is diet, some is health, some is genetics, some is age. One of my ladys cats was the runt of the litter; it wasnt certain she would survive, and she has always been both small and skinny. It hasnt seemed to limit her climbing/jumping much, if at all; I think she benefits from square/cube law to be stronger relative to her weight than you would expect. Another cat in the family was not only longer/taller/broader but also more solidly muscled. I think he may have weighed twice what the small one did, without being overweight. (The simplest rule-of-thumb test for whether a cat is overweight: if you can count every vertibra as you run your hand down their back, theyre fine. If some or all of them are hard to feel through the skin, theres probably more fat there than there should be. The runt really is below ideal weight; not only can you feel every bone in her back, its somewhat hard to believe there are muscles and tendons there. Especially true now that shes a senior catizen.)\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.0 \t\t Thank you for your question. You have a few different issues within your one question, but lets start with your main question regarding cats eating each others food. I have the same problem with my cats. I have one cat who gorges herself, and I have one skinny cat who likes to graze all day long. What do you do with this situation? It is not easy. You have to get a little creative. And unfortunately you will likely never get to the point where they will only eat their own food. However, you can get to a point where they mostly eat their own food. One thing to note is that cats tend to be dominant over certain things. Cats are not usually dominant over everything, like dogs tend to be. Some cats are dominant over food, which it sounds like your cat is. My thin cat will not eat unless my overweight cat is eating. You can see the obvious dominance there. Here are some ideas for you... KEEPING CATS FROM EATING EACH OTHERS FOOD I feed my cats wet food at night. I feed the slightly overweight cat in one place and my thin cat on a high shelf where she can see the other cat eating. During the day, I feed my overweight cat using an interactive feeder, so she has to use her natural instincts to work for her food. I give my skinny cat a small bowl of dry food on another shelf, so she can graze. Its not that my overweight cat cant get to the other food, but she is content to eat her easier-to-get food. Each morning, I also feed my skinny cat dry food in our closet, which is at the end of our walk-in bathroom. So there is quite a buffer from the bathroom door. I turn on the fan, so the other cat (who is closed out) cannot hear my skinny cat crunching. The things we do for our cats! I also sneak my skinny cat treats now and then. CATS EATING DOG FOOD This is a real problem for inside cats. You have to stop this. Even though your cats may be healthy now, eating dog food will make any cat overweight and unhealthy. I have volunteered at an animal shelter for many years and have seen this problem over and over again with overweight cats given to the shelter. Feed your dog at times you can supervise and take up the bowl when your dog is finished. If you kennel your dog, feed him in his kennel, so the cats cant get to the food. CAN CATS EAT VEGAN FOOD This is the most difficult part of your question because I can tell you have strong convictions in this area. However, I must tell you that cats should not ever be on a vegan diet. I am very sorry. I know this is difficult to hear. Cats were built to be obligate carnivores. They must have the taurine from the meat because they cannot produce it on their own, like dogs can. I know some vegan pet foods have synthetic taurine, but I wouldnt chance this. It is just not the same. Cats on a vegan diet will likely have severe medical conditions. See the quote below from Pet WebMD If allowed to continue long enough, these dietary problems can lead to serious and sometimes irreversible medical conditions. The one veterinarians mention most often is taurine-related dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart with weak contractions and poor pumping ability). Low taurine can also lead to reproductive failures, growth failures, and eye problems. I hope this helps and at least gives you some ideas. I wish you and your animal family the best!\n"

I feed him about 3-4 cups twice a day which averages about 130.00 a month. It is very important that you can afford this breed. I just had to take mine to the vet because he developed some sort of allergies on his skin, eyes and ears and the vet bill was $210.00 with all his medication. This wasnt an option I had to take him an get all his meds or he would have gotten worse. Theyre just like your children, you can expect things to come up and you need to be able to care for them.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 18.0 \t\t I breed mastiffs so I will try to help you with this: Age Amount 4-8 weeks 3-4 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 8-12 weeks 4-6 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 12-16 weeks 6-8 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 4 to 6 months 8-10 cups per day spread between 2-3 meals 6-18 months 8-12 cups per day spread between 2-3 meals These measurements are in another web site but I have been following this rule for years now. OK my point is, as a breeder if you have not even got the puppy yet and you are already saying that you cannot afford to spend too much in dog food do yourself a favor and dont get the dog. Why? English mastiffs need high quality food; their growth and life quality depends on it. Lets say you buy cheap dog food filled with byproduct stuff; now that dog is going to grow so fast and fat that, trust me, you are going to have an unhealthy dog for life. You already damaged the dogs joints etc. Now we are not talking about $5 or $15 dollars more on food. Now its about thousands of dollars on surgeries, therapies, and a life full of pain for your dog, you see is like a chain reaction. This is a good example: Blue Buffalo the biggest bag they sell is 30 pounds for $55 plus tax, so about $60. Each of my English mastiffs eat that in a 2 week period, so each mastiff will cost you just on food $120 a month. Now throw the vet bills etc. I am not saying that you have to feed them Blue Buffalo; there are other good quality dog foods out there, but this is the one I use and the one I recommend as the owner of 6 baby giants. I hope this has helped.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 16.6 \t\t This may be culturally specific (Im French), but I am really surprised that a one-year-old child eats so frequently, almost every hour. I would not be surprised if the feeding pattern prevents her to learn when she is hungry, or eating enough at each meal time. After a quick check of doctors recommendations in my country, a 4 meals pattern is considered standard as soon as the child eats solid. So breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner. But the number of feeding is expected to be progressively reduced from on demand (babies usually average 7-8 at 2 months) to 4 around 8 months old, so the transition must be smooth. EDIT: Here are the government recommendations (in French): http://inpes.santepubliquefrance.fr/CFESBases/catalogue/pdf/890.pdf Here are translations of relevant information: p23: [At 6 months] Very progressively, suppress part of a nursing, then an entire feeding. Wait one or two weeks to suppress a second feeding. This way, you should feed your baby around 8 months 4 meals a day, including two solid food meal (not more) and two nursing/bottles. p28: example of a daily menu for at least 6 months old, there are 4 meals, everything is included.

            "\t [1] \t\t 19.7 \t\t Amano shrimp are good tank mates for community fish. Theyll ignore your fish altogether. And they eat algae 24x7, which never hurts. Amano shrimp require brackish water for breeding, so wont breed in most tanks. This also makes them difficult to find. Cherry shrimp (and their color varieties) will also be no threat to your fish. But, they are very small, so aggressive fish (barbs, for example) may go after them. They breed quite easily and rapidly, so if you want more of them make sure you have plenty of hiding places for the young shrimp. Cherry shrimp are also algae eaters, though being so small youll need huge quantities of them to have an real impact if algae controll is a goal. Really, for most shrimp in tanks, the issue isnt if they are a danger to the fish, but if the fish will be a danger to the shrimps. Even larger shrimp may find their extremities and tails the target of nipping. The tetras shouldnt be a problem for the shrimp, but the loaches may go after them. Edit: One heads up about shrimp (and most aquarium invertebrates, actually). A lot of medications and chemicals you might use in a tank are poisonous to them. So once they are in there, youll need to be extra careful with what you put into the tank, and check that it is safe for shrimp.\n",

I recently replaced the betta and the new one will not leave the zebra snail alone - always flaring, swimming around him and nipping at his shell. The snail (about 1.5 inch / 3.8 cm long) doesnt seem to care and will hopefully be fine. I dont know what to do to get the fish to leave him alone!\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 18.5 \t\t Shrimp wont cause any noticeable bioload in a tank, especially a 60l one, and they wont stress out any inhabitants other than solo fish, such as a betta, which shouldnt really have anything sharing the tank with it anyway. As for using them as food, Im not sure itd work - if you fish dont actively eat the shrimp currently, then they are unlikely to be bothered about eating them once they are dead either as they are likely herbivores If you happen to have another tank that has loaches in (I know both Pakistani and Clown loaches will) they will eat shrimps and snails quite happily.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 25.5 \t\t Serpae tetras are by nature fin nippers. They are only second to tiger barbs. Although I always wanted to have them again, I restrained myself knowing what they are capable of. It is just their nature. The docile Neon tetras can become aggressive to each other if you have fewer than half a dozen of them. Ive seen aggression in Neons in my small 5 gallon tank where I kept 1 betta, 4 neons, 1 cory and 2 black neons. The aggression stopped when I add 2 more neons. My 5 gallon tank is mainly just for the betta and the tetras are just tank mates. Bottom line, if a normally docile neon tetra becomes aggressive with few numbers how much more to a naturally aggressive Serpae. Mind you my neon tetras came from a larger population in my larger tank.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 19.4 \t\t Serpae tetras tend to be less aggressive if kept in a larger group, like more than 6-8. This does not ensure the occasional nip at a peaceful cory. Kindly do a bit of research before grouping together fish in a community tank. There are a number of online resources to find out compatibility between different fish. A community aquarium needs fish which can tolerate a similar range of water temperature, pH, and gH/kH. Once this particular need is matched, you need to know about aggressive fish species. Corydora catfish need non aggressive tank-mates, and they MUST be kept in groups of 6 or more. Cory cats get very very stressed if kept in a lower number.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 16.8 \t\t So, Im going to slightly disagree with the idea to keep AND add to the rainbows pop. This is one of my favorite breeds of freshwater community fish too, so although my heart says keep those beauties, my experience says differently. They get about 4 (10 cm) in length and need a decent sized school to be happy. Its said that if you have a proper school a 50+ gallon (190+ liters) tank is whats necessary. Volume isnt the issue with these guys, its the length of the tank thats needed for their swimming patterns. They are lateral swimmers, middle dwellers, and need the length of 48 (around 120 cm) of more unfortunately. Id say remove the two turquoise rainbows (especially since theyll get the biggest), two more zebra danios and add two more corys. I think your 5 cherry barb and 5 serpae tetras WILL be fine the way they are. Since its a 30 gallon, and since your question shows your concern for overcrowding. Good luck and have fun!\n",
            "#> do neon tetras eat shrimp?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 28.7 \t\t Neon tetras will indeed eat baby shrimp. So they can be used for population control. But keep in mind that you do have to try to keep some of the babies alive. Otherwise you might end up without any shrimp after a while. From your other post, it seems like your tank wont have many hiding places for the shrimp. So you might want to add a few real plants and moss (shrimp will love this) and a shrimp cave. Especially when shrimp are shedding their skin, they are more vulnerable and also need a more quiet place to hide.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 27.5 \t\t Neon tetras will attempt to eat these. Ive kept neon tetras with shrimp and they would often pursue the baby shrimp. Luckily for the shrimp, theyre pretty fast and hard to see so the fish would rarely get them. Whilst the fry will attempt to hide or run away continuously from the tetras if chased, it will probably either end with the fry being too stressed (because of all the chasing) or they will be eaten. If you have a heavily planted tank then you may get away with it because there is much more cover to hide in but there is a risk. I would put them into a fry tank which sits in the same tank to allow the water to flow through it but the fry is unable to get out. (The one linked actually looks a bit small so you may wish to find another). This means the fry will grow larger and then you can eventually let them free into the main tank with no acclimatisation required.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 25.4 \t\t Shrimp and fish is not a really good idea. The explanation is simple, the problem is the zoeas (baby shrimp). All small fish, like tetra neon, etc. can eat them so this is a problem for the reproduction of your shrimp as well. Some options can be: Use only herbivorous fish, some examples can be Otocinclus affinis, Stiphodon sp., Corydoras pygmaeus or Gyrinocheilus aymonieri. These fish doesnt eat zoeas. Use rasboras or fish like Boraras brigittae or Poecilia wingei, these fish can eat zoeas so you need to put plants in your tank to make refuges for your shrimp. Other examples: Celestichthys margaritatus Hemigrammus rodwayi Ember Tetra Flame Tetra Crystal Red Tetra You can try to put big fish in your tank, like Metynnis argenteus, this is an herbivorous fish and is cool to see when it grows to its maximum size. They dont attack other fishes. Surface fish like hatchet fish can be a good option in this tank, because the shrimp are bottom dwellers of the tank. You have another great options here, just make a search and you can find some good candidates for the aquarium. Bad options: Single Betta male, this is a really aggressive and territorial fish so you will have problems with other fish in the tank and with the shrimps. Pentazona barbs or other barbs are a big problem, because these guys grow to a significant size and you will lose all your shrimp if they find them. If you put assassin snails without putting others snails, assassin snails will die because they eat other snails, so you would need to feed them with other snails. They can eat other animal-based foods, but with other snails you dont need to keep feeding them with other alimentation. Put fish with a large size, because you will have problem with other fish and with the shrimp.\n",
            "#> how much should i feed my english mastiff?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 20.0 \t\t I breed mastiffs so I will try to help you with this: Age Amount 4-8 weeks 3-4 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 8-12 weeks 4-6 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 12-16 weeks 6-8 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 4 to 6 months 8-10 cups per day spread between 2-3 meals 6-18 months 8-12 cups per day spread between 2-3 meals These measurements are in another web site but I have been following this rule for years now. OK my point is, as a breeder if you have not even got the puppy yet and you are already saying that you cannot afford to spend too much in dog food do yourself a favor and dont get the dog. Why? English mastiffs need high quality food; their growth and life quality depends on it. Lets say you buy cheap dog food filled with byproduct stuff; now that dog is going to grow so fast and fat that, trust me, you are going to have an unhealthy dog for life. You already damaged the dogs joints etc. Now we are not talking about $5 or $15 dollars more on food. Now its about thousands of dollars on surgeries, therapies, and a life full of pain for your dog, you see is like a chain reaction. This is a good example: Blue Buffalo the biggest bag they sell is 30 pounds for $55 plus tax, so about $60. Each of my English mastiffs eat that in a 2 week period, so each mastiff will cost you just on food $120 a month. Now throw the vet bills etc. I am not saying that you have to feed them Blue Buffalo; there are other good quality dog foods out there, but this is the one I use and the one I recommend as the owner of 6 baby giants. I hope this has helped.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 19.0 \t\t I have a 2 1/2 year old bull mastiff. I have been feeding him Blue Buffalo since I got him at 8 weeks old. He is very lean and active for a bull mastiff. I feed him about 3-4 cups twice a day which averages about 130.00 a month. It is very important that you can afford this breed. I just had to take mine to the vet because he developed some sort of allergies on his skin, eyes and ears and the vet bill was $210.00 with all his medication. This wasnt an option I had to take him an get all his meds or he would have gotten worse. Theyre just like your children, you can expect things to come up and you need to be able to care for them.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 18.2 \t\t Based on this dog food calculator. A full grown mastiff will grow to be about 150-200 pounds1. Which means a 180 pound mastiff2 with what the site considers a typical activity level, and food with a kcal amount of 320 per cup3. Youre looking at roughly 10-11 cups of food twice a day. Alternatively, that would be about 2 pounds of food each meal. Multiply 4 pounds of food with 7 days in a week and that means youre looking at 28 pounds of food each week. Now thats a pretty rough estimate since you dont have the dog (or at least not yet), but you can play around with the calculator to figure out if those numbers are anything that you think you should be worried about. Note that if your dog happens to be larger, or even just more active, than the average it could very well need more food. And, depending on the type of food you purchase, it might need to eat more in order to receive the calories it needs in a day. The quality of food makes a difference, and the prices of food is related to the quality. In my opinion, if you have any concerns about being able to afford a 30 pound bag of dog food each week, then you should avoid large breed dogs. Keep in mind that you should be prepared to be able to afford to take your pet to a veterinarian if need be. That is an expense on top of the others. You should never have to skip feeding your pet in order to afford a vet bill. Also, if it turns out its allergic to certain ingredients you should be prepared to buy more expensive brands of food that exclude those ingredients. 1 http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/mastiff 2 My estimated average weight based on the breeds weight range. 3 Based on the contents of Purina One healthy weight adult dog food.\n",
            "#> is cat skin tougher than human skin?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 21.2 \t\t Dish soap, bar soap, liquid soap, shampoo (for humans) is a no-no for cats (or dogs). Cats skin is a significantly different Ph than human skin and using these products can cause irritation, itching, allergies, etc. Additionally, when they groom themselves, they can ingest chemical traces that may cause other issues in the future. For good flea control, there are many, many methods and products. Do a search here on the site and you will find many answers for flea control. I use Comfortis on my cat and dog and have been extremely pleased. They both have no reaction to the treatment.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.1 \t\t It sounds like you did the best thing you could do in the given situation. One of the main reasons why you shouldnt use human shampoo on a cat (or bathe it at all if its not absolutely necessary) is that human skin is more acidic than cat skin. Bathing a cat with human shampoo would feel like washing yourself with undiluted vinegar. In addition to that, cats produce almost no sebum (skin oil) at all. The sebum protects the skin and hair from drying out and getting damaged, but it also makes the hair look oily. Most humans can go a week at most without washing their hair. After a few days the human body already produces so much sebum your hair looks oily. Human shampoo is designed to wash that amount of sebum away. A cats skin produces so little sebum it takes them several weeks--up to several months--to produce enough sebum to recreate the protective skin barrier again. Washing cats with human shampoo dries their skin out rather extremely and causes irritation, itching and scratching, and other symptoms of dry skin like dandruff; it can also increase the risk of skin infections. Some ingredients in human shampoo can even poison your cat! Rubbing the dirty fur with plain water or a specialized cat shampoo is the best way to remove dirt from the fur. Very diluted baby shampoo seems to be the next best option and some people use very diluted dish soap. One last note: at 2 years of age it is no longer a kitten, its an adult cat ;)\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.7 \t\t Cats are famous for having very thick skin so maybe the snake cannot puncture very deep into the flesh and the venom is only inserted into/under the skin, not into the muscles. If the venom is not into the muscles (where the big blood vessels are) it is not carried immediately to the organs. This gives time to the organism to fight against the poison (or you to go to the vet). Also the cats react much much faster than dogs or humans, so they could jump away when they feel the teeth penetrating the skin. So the snake wont have enough time to inject a full dose.

            "#> how to tell the difference between a girl and boy bearded dragon?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 19.9 \t\t Some people will say that there are ways to tell the sex of a bearded dragon based on its behaviour. Males in general might be more likely to show their beard, females in general might be more likely to wave their arms in greeting. Ive even heard people saying that female bearded dragons are smaller than males. While these may be true sometimes, its important to remember that these are all anecdotal, and isnt a definitive way of determining the sex of your bearded dragon. The only sure way is to look at what are called hemipenal bulges. While I wouldnt say that determining the sex by looking at the hemipenal bulges is 100% accurate, they are the most accurate method of sexing your dragon (Right after finding it laying eggs). Note: The male hemipenal bulges might be bulges might not be developed enough to see until the bearded dragon is grown 6-7 inches in length. Until then, it will probably look very similar to a females. The hemipenal bulges on a male bearded dragon will be two bulges, one on each side of the tail following the vent. (Source) The hemipenal bulges on a female bearded dragon will be one single bulge in the center of the tail following the vent. (Source) If you are having trouble determining which sex you have, it can actually help a lot to take a small flashlight and shine some light through the tail. You should see the shadows of the testes if its a male. (Source) Bearded dragons are one of the lizards who have Femoral Pores. Commonly referred to as preanal pores. These are used to secrete pheromones, especially during mating season. These pores are located on the underside of the hind legs, running from knee to knee, and are generally more prominent on males. Though anecdotal, if youre unsure of the hemipenal bulge it might be the best you can use. Now, lets talk about the elephant in the room. Its called probing. Probing is the practice of forcing open the vent, and pulling the sex organs out, either with a pair of tweezers or what is essentially a pair chopsticks, in order to view them. If anyone suggests that probing your bearded dragon is an acceptable way of sexing your dragon, the proper response is to repeatedly smack them over the head with a rolled up newspaper until they leave in shame. Probing bearded dragons, or any lizard really, carries a huge risk for causing damage. It is one thing to force open the vent and pull the organs out, and another to put everything back in and close the vent without causing any damage. If anyone were to be able to successfully probe your bearded dragon, it would be a veterinarian that has a long history of treating reptiles. While I normally place a pretty high value to breeders, I cannot condone anyone performing this method of sexing lizards who has not dedicated their lives to the medical care of reptiles. Common issues that arise from probing bearded dragons include but are not limited to: Internal bleeding from pinched sex organs and/or intestines. Bruising of the sex organs and/or intestines. Prolapse, and increased risk of prolapsing in the future, from damage to the vent and/or intestines. Infection(s) from exposing the tissue thats normally protected by the vent. Note: Probing snakes poses less risk than lizards, though I still disagree with it as a method personally. But because of it, probing kits are sold. I have seen people buy these kits thinking they can use them for lizards, and people selling them to people to use on their lizards. This should never be done for any reason.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 17.9 \t\t I like Valkyries answer very much: show him counter-examples. I also agree with balanced mama, that his having concrete ideas about the differences between boys and girls is developmental. Id just add one more thing, looking at it from your sons point of view: Hes noticed that girls and boys are different, and more importantly, that they are treated -- unless youre living in a very enlightened area! -- differently by the adults around them. Ill bet someone recently and oh-so-helpfully told him what those differences are, and that this little bit of info seems to match what he sees around him, so hes incorporated it into his knowledge of the world. Girls play with dolls, Bella at the daycare is a girl; Bella plays with dolls. It holds up. He may even have gone further and incorporated it into his knowledge of himself. He is a boy; boys like trucks; he likes trucks. Yay! He has mastered the boy-girl difference. It fits in with what he sees of the world, and his world behaves in a way he can predict. Now you are telling him that not all girls like pink, or dolls, or flowers, and that some boys like pink, or dolls, or flowers and insisting he accept that. I bet he loves you very much and wants to believe what you are telling him, but you are contradicting what he has just learned of the world, and rejecting his newly learned categorizing skills, the ones that work! And you not replacing them with anything! No wonder hes resisting your insistance, and is probably more than a little confused. Children at that age like a black-and-white world; something either is a thing or it is not. What I would suggest is you validate his reasoning and reinforce his sense of identity without reinforcing western cultural stereotypes. Lots of girls do like to play with dolls, but not all, and some like to play with trucks as well. Lots of boys like to play with trucks, but not all. The people who make TV shows sometimes like to do it the easy way, so they show girls only doing things that most girls like, and boys only doing things that most boys like, because they dont want people who watch the show to be confused. The problem is that sometimes the children watching TV shows havent tried to play with both dolls and trucks and dont know how much fun both can be, so they think they only can play with the toys shown on the TV shows. But real people like all sorts of different things, and we want to let our friends play with the types of toys they want to play with. With my own child I would (and did) go further: He is a boy because he has boy parts, just like other boys, and he will grow up to be a man like his father. It doesnt matter whether he plays with dolls or trucks, he will always be a boy. (I would not mention trans-gendered people to a three-year old.) Girls are girls because they have girl parts, and will grow up to be women like his mother. (You may want to add here that girls and boys parts are private, and its rude to want to look at them.) I recognize that not every parent wants to open this can of worms when their child is so young, but I think most kids (especially if they are around babies being changed) have already noticed these differences. In a few years he will outgrow the need for a simple world where everything obeys rigid rules, and be open to the multitude of counter-examples you are showing him, but until then, if you base his boy-ness on his physical body, he may find it safe to play with girl toys, and to let girls play with boy toys. One more thing, if I may. There are plenty of TV shows that do not show the sexes behaving according to strict gendered stereotypes. (Caillou and Curious George spring to mind.) If the daycare must have TV on, can you have any impact on what shows are shown? Good luck!\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 17.7 \t\t I dont think your son is stereotyping so much as he is learning to classify. He has noticed there is a difference between girls and boys, and he knows hes a boy and that his mother and some of his friends are girls, and in his mind he is trying to figure out what that means. Rather than focusing on correcting his stereotypes, or trying to correct them with ideas that suggest there are no differences between genders, you should try turning the discussion to ways that boys and girls ARE different: Girls can grow up to be mommies and boys can grow up to be daddies. Girls have vulvas and boys have penises. When we go to McDonalds there is one bathroom for girls and one for boys. When boys are small they can go in the girls bathroom if they are with their mom, because their mom is a girl. But usually boys go in the boys bathroom. Youre right, a lot of girls do like dolls. Since Karen is a girl, lets ask her if she likes dolls. Youre right, a lot of girls like pink. Since Mom is a girl, lets ask her if she likes pink. Is that person a girl or a boy? What makes you think that? (Son lists characteristics he observes). I think youre right. Usually its boys who wear suits with ties. Plus he has whiskers! OR Hmm, yes girls usually wear longer hair than boys, but Im not sure that is a girl. What else do you notice? Understanding finer differences will come at a later age. In fact, a 3-year-old will often find it humorous if you suggest someone is a boy that does not fit in with his brains rule for what is a boy. I remember one of my kids coming home from pre-school at age 4 saying he wanted his friend Andrew to come to our house to play. I asked which Andrew (since there were 2 in his class), and he said, Andrew the girl! Of course, it was the Andrew with shoulder length curly hair instead of the Andrew with short hair like his own. So not to worry! Hes just practicing a new skill which is still a bit rough.\n",
            "#> can i put a goldfish in a 2 gallon tank?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.0 \t\t Jestep has a good answer, but sometime it helps to be able to visualize things. With the exception of a few show goldfish, which will only grow to about 10 inches in length, an adult goldfish is going to be about 14-18 inches long. You didnt say what species of goldfish you had, so Im assuming its the common comet goldfish that all pet stores sell. They will easily be at the upper end of the scale as long as you can keep them alive. To put this into perspective, a standard 2.5 gallon tank is usually only 13 inches long1, although they can be shorter if you buy a special kit. This means that for a tank to be big enough for a goldfish, you pretty much need to be able to wave a 2.5 gallon tank around the inside of it. Most tanks, aside from a 40g breeder tank, are only 13 inches deep, meaning the goldfish wouldnt be able to turn around without bending its spine too much. Goldfish are active swimmers so they need to be able to swim back and forth as they feel like it. I would take the fish back to the pet store, they should have no problem with you returning it, although they might only give you a refund if its been within a certain time frame. You could probably get a betta for the tank, although in my opinion a 2.5 gallon tank is still a bit small for them. I would personally turn it into a nano tank with some plants/moss and some shrimp. Thats personal preference though. What youll really want to do is look around at your local pet store, and see what fish they have available. Then be sure to look up how large the fish grows to as an adult, and if its a schooling fish that will require tankmates. Dont be afraid to visit just to write down names to look up at home. 1For reference, here is a site with a list of tank dimensions based on their size in gallons/liters: http://www.anapsid.org/resources/tanksize.html\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.5 \t\t Return the goldfish and get a beta. Thats realistically the only fish that can survive long term in a 2.5 gallon aquarium. Your typical comet goldfish will need at least 30 gallons of water each to stay healthy long term. Theyre very messy fish and even in a small but suitable tank, owners often have major water quality issues. Before you get another fish, read up on how to properly cycle a fish tank. If you take a fish tank, regardless of the size, and just put water and conditioner and fish in it, most fish will be dead in about a week due to ammonia poisoning. An aquarium must cycle before it is ready to house fish. Cycling is the process of building up beneficial bacteria. This bacteria is what actually filters the water in any fish tank, beit freshwater or saltwater. Cycling a tank typically takes around 4 weeks and is complete when ammonia and nitrite can no longer be detected in a tank, while nitrate is detected and stable or rising. Petsmart is notorious for employing untrained people in their aquatics departments, and they routinely sell customers fish and aquarium setups that are impossible to maintain. In our aquarium club its probably a weekly or bi-weekly event that someone shows up trying to keep their tank alive because petsmart or petco sold them a setup that was impossible to keep going, or even get established, and theyve lost all their fish multiple times as a result.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.2 \t\t So, goldfish are glutinous fish and produce a lot of waste. As the comments above indicate, your tank size is too small. It is a common misconception that goldfish can live happy, healthy lives in small containment, like a bowl or small tank. They can live in small containers - but not in a happy and healthy way - unfortunately pop culture, like TV, movies, carnivals and unfortunately even some pet stores, show goldfish in bowls and this is only something their bodies can handle temporarily. The waste they produce causes a heavy build-up of ammonia, nitrates and nitrites, that make small containment basically a toxic environment for them, that can make them lame or depressed in personality and ultimately sick, and without proper care will lead to their death. One good thing that makes things a little easier is that goldfish can withstand colder temperatures than tropical fish, meaning a heater is unnecessary, but because of how dirty they are they need filtration and weekly partial water changes. The general rule of thumb is one gallon per one inch (around 1.5 L per 1cm) of projected growth of fish - so a 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) goldfish that gets to 8 inches (20 cm) needs at least 8 gallons (30 L) of water, and 2 of them means 16 gallons (60 L) of water, and so forth. If finances are an issue try finding a used tank at a yard sale or online, thoroughly clean it, and start from scratch by adding your existing water, filling the rest with treated fresh and adding a biological filtration additive like Cycle to Eco In a Bottle or Stresszyme and follow the instructions, sometimes daily or a week, and typically weekly from their forward for a month until your tank has gone through the nitrogen cycle. Adding live plants and a filter will help keep your water clear, and will stay much cleaner and healthier than without a filter. Im happy to see you have gravel, as that will help as part of your filtration once you have a bigger set up. You will need additional gravel, approximately 1 to 1.5 lbs per gallon of tank (0.12 to 0.18 kg per liter) and if your fish is still acting lame you may need to use this site to better diagnose an illness that may need additional treatment. Also, once filtration is in place, invest in a cheap container of freshwater aquarium salt and follow instructions on the back based on your tank size. It will help to prevent some future scale and fin issues, add electrolytes to the water, and can later be used in larger doses as a sickness cure. Good luck. P.S. If you have done a water change and he seems a little healthier or more active, this is simply a temporary fix to the problem, and has given him some relief from the built up ammonia. Also, having a light thats on during the day and off at night will help simulate a natural sun cycle, also healthier for fish activity.\n",

Some are actively vicious and will attack snails and eat them. Others are totally fine around snails or particular types of snails. It also seemed like some of the cases were similar to yours, in which the betta seemed to live peacefully with the snail for a while, but then suddenly the snail was gone (in that case though, I believe the snail might have been sick and the betta only ate it when it was close to being dead.)

Reptiles have whats referred to as a hemipenis, and because of the way its positioned in their tail, the males tail will be thicker after the cloacal opening when compared with a female, whos tail will taper immediately after the cloacal. (Source) Another, potentially more reliable method, is by counting the scales after the cloacal. Simply count the rows from the cloacal to the tip of the tail. 130 or less is a good sign that you have a female. 140 or more is a good sign that you have a male. If you count somewhere in between 130 and 140 then its not going to be definitive to say. In this case I would suggest also looking at the shape of the tail for that thicker section. Note: Unless you have an extremely well behaved snake, its going to be hard to count the scales on it. So I would suggest taking a picture, or even using one if its shed skin. Of course these are all going to be reliable to a fault, and aside from putting two snakes together and waiting to see if they mate, the only way to know for sure is by probing or popping the cloacal opening to see the sex organs. As Ive mentioned in one of my other answers Im against these practices because I believe its an unnecessary risk considering the damages that can be caused by it. While its debatable about whether or not snakes are less at risk to the damage than lizards, I would insist that anyone wanting to perform the procedure themselves have hands-on training from someone with experience (and that you can trust) first. Only someone with training should probe a snake. My suggestion is to try the non-invasive methods first, then if youre not convinced after that, you can take it to a reptile vet to have it sexed. As a new pet, its a good idea to have a check-up from a vet anyways, so you can have it checked for parasites at the same time.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.0 \t\t From what I have gathered the only way to be absolutely certain is by probing which should only be done by a herpetologist. However, that may not always be possible, so you can also determine based on the tail. Males have thicker and longer tails, while the females have short and thin tails. Other details can be the size of the snake altogether since males are normally larger, however some exceptions may be out there. Also, male corn snakes that are on the bigger side often have subtle dark streaks that travel down the length of their bodies -- four in total. These streaks do not generally appear in the smaller males of the species, however. Hope this helps\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.5 \t\t What you have there is referred to as a tassel-ear. You are correct that corn is a monecious flower, but the way it develops is a little different. When the flower (both tassel and ear) first form they are perfect flowers (both male and female). During normal development different hormones are sent to the tassel and the ear, causing the tassel-flower to become male and the ear-flower female. However, when the corn plant is tillered things can get messy, a few misdirected hormones and suddenly the plant is trying to grow an ear where there should be a tassel. The exact cause isnt fully clear, even to Agriculture Universities like Purdue, but it mainly happens on tillers, rarely on the main-stem tassel. As for saving the seeds, the genetic information should be the same, but there is a potential for problems with the physical seed. The tassel ear lacks a husk, which creates a very high potential for bird damage, weathering and disease, all of which can take a serious toll on your seeds fitness.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 25.0 \t\t Will Can my rabbit be harmed by e-coli on Lettuce? Probably not; the majority of store bought foods are safe. While there are risks, your bunny and you have about the same risk (assuming developed country) they really are not any higher or lower risk from food contamination then you are. Both you and your bunny have a gut populated by helpful bacteria including E-coli. Can my rabbit be harmed by e-coli on Lettuce? Yes, there are several different strains of E-coli (Escherichia coli) most are harmless and can found in intestines of warm blooded animals (including people) in many cases these are helpful bacteria. BUT some strains like Escherichia coli O157:H7 which is currently and often in the news is harmful. Results of infection in rabbits is much like that in humans; starting with diarrhea in 1 to 10 days, with other complications that can and do lead to death, particularly in the very young and old. Rabbit can become infected with harmful strains of E-coli in the same ways as humans. As with humans they can also pass it to others. Rabbits and humans can pass the infection to each other. It is important for the health of you and your rabbit that you take the same precautions when feeding them leafy greens, as you would take if you were consuming them yourself. All the different strains of E-coli are spread by the same several ways; water, organic fertilizer, bird droppings, human handling, etc. The different strains are not regional, there are carriers of all them all around the world. While a particular regional source is often identified in news reports for mass events, every raw leafy green vegetable is potentially infected.

If the vegetables have imported tag then you should be worried. As an exception baby rabbits have weak immunity systems and they may not have gotten the strains from their mothers yet so if your rabbit has babies then those babies might be at the risk of e-coli.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 20.9 \t\t Himalayan salt is typically used for cooking.. I would recommend you go to your local pet store and buy some aquarium specific salt. Like this one. 3 bucks and you know youre getting exactly what you need! Please dontt use the cooking salt/seasoning salt, use fish salt!\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 17.0 \t\t My opinion would be similar to @trondhansen in the way that- theres not anything you can do to fix, BUT Id say there are things you can do to help make your Molly either more comfortable or to prevent infection or to help with any scales that may have fallen off in process to regenerate. Adding a dose of fresh water aquarium salt helps with scale reproduction, and would be soothing to any tears. There are ways to clean it BUT your fish has gone thru something VERY stressful, so for that purpose I would stick with a antiseptic tank additive. One that I can think of off the top of my head is made by Seachem called Stress Guard... Added a pic of it. But yes, as previously stated, your fish may heal but not go back to normal. Also, aquarium salt is my go to for a lot of freshwater fish issues, but it is an especially safe additive to use in Molly due to how salt tolerant they are and that they can be acclimated to brackish and saltwater (although I dont recommend doing this if you dont know what youre doing) I felt it was a good point to add. Good luck, shes pretty.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 16.7 \t\t You need to stop feeding your fish for some time while you wait for the bacteria to grow to a level where they can handle the ammonia and nitrite in your tank. To lower the danger of nitrite poisoning you can add aquarium salt so the concentration is at 0,3% salt in your tank (most fish will handle this concentration of salt for a long time). You need to change about 20% of the water today to get the level of toxins down (remember to use a dechlorinator when you change water). Take daily water tests until the level of nitrite starts to go down. In a tank that is properly cycled, this does not take long. Next time you clean your filter be sure not to change more than 30-50% of the filter media to keep the biological cyclus going in your tank. You do not need to clean the filter until you can see the water flow is reduced. If you have filter foam/sponges in your filter, you only need to rinse it. Be sure to use water from your tank when you rinse the foam to avoid chlorine killing the bacteria. Your fish looks like it has got an fungal infection. If possible, treat your fish in a separate tank. This is to avoid medicating the main tank, as this will kill the nitrifying bacteria and cause problems for the rest of your fish.\n",
            "#> is my corn snake overweight?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 19.7 \t\t While its sometimes normal to see your snakes skin between the scales immediately after feeding, thats because they swallow their food whole and its pressing on their skin. If youre seeing the skin between the scales otherwise, then your snake is definitely overweight. I wouldnt use the spine as a reference for whether your snake is over/under weight, as all snakes, except for the obese ones, will still show their spine. A more accurate method is too look at the shape of the snake. Despite how theyre portrayed, they arent actually round. A snake thats underweight will be more triangle shape, with the sides leading straight from the belly to the spine. A healthy snake will be rounded at the top, but flat on the bottom, kind of like a half circle. The purpose is to have as much surface area (for traction) on their stomach as possible. An overweight snake will be rounded, sometimes almost perfectly, with sides of the belly not able to touch the ground. Another thing you might be able to notice are hips/rolls on you snake. All snakes will have creases when theyre coiled up, but an overweight snake will have more fat in those creases and it can cause noticeable rolls, or even misshapen scales. The misshapen scales are generally the worst cases I think, they come from the pressure of the extra fat in the creases. (source) [Notice here too, the stomach doesnt lay flat] As far as feeding schedules go, you should always keep a strict feeding schedule for all pets. Its especially important for corn snakes since theyre opportunistic feeders, theyll eat even when they shouldnt. Common feeding schedules for adult corn snakes are more like once every 12-14 days. That might seem like a pretty open schedule, but that all depends on what youre feeding him. Larger or fattier food needs to be fed less often. I would say start by feeding him only once every 12 days, and give him some exercise. You can give him some exercise by having him climb up and down a set of stair if you have some, or if he doesnt hate baths, you could encourage him to swim every so often in the bathtub. One trick I really like, is giving them a box full of cardboard tubes, from paper towels and stuff. Just the new environment will encourage them to explore, and youll have fun watching him explore the maze of tubes. It will take quite a while to see some improvement. Just like with humans, snakes wont lose weight within a week. I know some cases where its taken a whole year for people to get their snakes back to a healthy weight. Stick to a longer feeding schedule, and encourage your snake to exercise as much as possible, and hell be fine.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 19.0 \t\t I did some research comparing the two different kinds of snakes. My research is showed below. Everything highlighted is cited and everything not cited is from my own experience and handling snakes myself. Adult corn snakes need a cage at least the size of a 20 gallon (76 liters) long aquarium, but bigger is even better. Snakes are not social animals, so cage-mates are quite stressful. House only one corn snake to a cage. Climbing branches may be appreciated, but a couple of dark, tight hides are essential to help the snake feel secure. A general rule is that if the snake crawls around the perimeter of the cage and doesnt cover more than 2/3 of the distance, the cage is large enough – but bigger is better. An adult California king snake requires a 20 gallon (76 liters) or larger enclosure. From experience 2 things. Dont keep two snakes in the same cage because it can be stressful with the other snake because they arent social animals. Snakes have been known to be cannibals to other snakes so having 2 snakes in the same cage isnt a good idea. Second thing is that your habitat for the snake has to be secure. If a snake can find a weak spot before you can, then the snake can get out and potentially cause problems depending on the snake. But I dont think that people would want snakes running around their house. Cage Substrate Corn Snake: Most breeders use aspen shavings as bedding because it is absorbent, soft and holds its shape when snakes burrow. Cypress mulch also works, but avoid aromatic woods such as pine or cedar. Newspaper and reptile carpet also suffice, but the corn snake tends to get under it whenever possible. Avoid sand because it may cause impactions if ingested. King Snake Substrate Many commercial substrates and beddings for reptiles are available. Avoid cat litter and any chemically treated substrates and oily woods. General rule, if it looks good and doesnt give off a smell, it is OK. Feed your California king snake in a separate container if the substrate could be ingested while feeding. Newspaper, paper towels and indoor carpet are fine, but if the snake cant partially burrow in your substrate, you might consider a hide or two in the cage for security. Food Corn Snake The primary natural food of corn snakes is appropriately sized rodents. Adult corn snakes may eat birds or their eggs. Do not offer crickets because corn snakes don’t recognize them as food. Food King Snake In captivity they should be fed rodents, usually mice, which are readily available. You can offer live or well-thawed frozen mice. Live adult mice can inflict wounds to your king snake. Fresh killed is a safer choice. Temperature for a King Snake California kingsnakes require no special lighting if the cage is in a room with natural light. Be sure not to place the cage in or near a window where the sun will shine on the cage, or it can become too hot and fatal for your king snake. In captivity, choices are limited to what you provide so you should have a warm end and a cool end of your cage. Try to achieve 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 °C) at one end and in the 70s °F (around 24 °C) at the cool end. Do not use hot rocks, the heat is too centralized and can cause burns. Temperature for a Corn Snake Provide a temperature gradient with a light, or undertank heat pad or cable. On the warm end 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 °C) is perfect, and room temperatures (low 70s °F / around 21 °C) are fine for the cool end. One long, skinny hide, such as a hollow log or PVC pipe, can be placed so one end of the hide is cool and one end is warm. Be sure to check the temperature inside the warm end of the hide — not on the glass. Temperatures can vary quite a bit within just a few inches, so thermometer and hide box placement is important. Always for both snakes feed them at least every 7 to 10 days. If your snake is an adult avoid feeding it too much because it can cause obesity. In the end the only difference is the difference in Caging Substrate and food but the food items to the snake can blend in because you can feed both rodents.

            "\t [3] \t\t 18.9 \t\t There are several reasons why a snake such as a corn snake might exhibit this sort of behaviour. Without more specific information about your particular case1 its impossible to say which could apply to your snake, but theyre all worth checking. It could have a respiratory infection (RI). You say it doesnt show signs of being ill, but look closely for signs of bubbles coming out of its nose. If this is the case then it needs medical attention. It could have mites. These can be really hard to see, but the main behaviour I would expect would be for it to sit in its water bowl for hours on end. In the UK, Callingtons is possibly the most widely-available good quality brand for dealing with them if thats the case. It could be the start of a shedding process, and its trying to loosen the skin around its face to start unpeeling. This should resolve itself in the normal way within a week or possibly two, though you should monitor the humidity levels and keep them higher than normal. It might be because its hungry so is hunting. Again, youve not said enough for us to know whether this might apply in your case, but its a possibility. Or perhaps its not hungry as such but wants variety in its diet. It might not be hungry but it might still be able to smell something interesting (perhaps you) and want to get closer to investigate. Corns are particularly good with their sense of smell, so thats a possibility to work on. It might be trying to escape. This would be more likely if it was unhappy in its enclosure, either because the heat was too high or too low, or the humidity was wrong, or it didnt have anywhere to feel secure such as a hide, or the water bowl is dirty, or in the wrong place, or it doesnt like the substrate ... the list just goes on. Look closely at the snakes environment1 from the snakes perspective and see if any could be changed safely. Or it could be that its just an inquisitive snake, and wants to know whats outside. 1 Basic husbandry checklist: enough space to roam secure place/places to hide light/dark at appropriate times temperature range (cool -> warm) humidity substrate cleanliness water supply diet appropriate, regular handling\n",
            "#> are some cats just skinny?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.4 \t\t A cat can certainly be naturally skinny. I know one who was the runt of her litter and has been extremely thin all her life, to the point where you can easily count every bone. She is now 17 years old, having outlived two other cats in that household, so it certainly doesnt seem to have held her back.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.0 \t\t Yes. Just like us, cats vary in size and shape and weight. And like us, some of that is diet, some is health, some is genetics, some is age. One of my ladys cats was the runt of the litter; it wasnt certain she would survive, and she has always been both small and skinny. It hasnt seemed to limit her climbing/jumping much, if at all; I think she benefits from square/cube law to be stronger relative to her weight than you would expect. Another cat in the family was not only longer/taller/broader but also more solidly muscled. I think he may have weighed twice what the small one did, without being overweight. (The simplest rule-of-thumb test for whether a cat is overweight: if you can count every vertibra as you run your hand down their back, theyre fine. If some or all of them are hard to feel through the skin, theres probably more fat there than there should be. The runt really is below ideal weight; not only can you feel every bone in her back, its somewhat hard to believe there are muscles and tendons there. Especially true now that shes a senior catizen.)\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.0 \t\t Thank you for your question. You have a few different issues within your one question, but lets start with your main question regarding cats eating each others food. I have the same problem with my cats. I have one cat who gorges herself, and I have one skinny cat who likes to graze all day long. What do you do with this situation? It is not easy. You have to get a little creative. And unfortunately you will likely never get to the point where they will only eat their own food. However, you can get to a point where they mostly eat their own food. One thing to note is that cats tend to be dominant over certain things. Cats are not usually dominant over everything, like dogs tend to be. Some cats are dominant over food, which it sounds like your cat is. My thin cat will not eat unless my overweight cat is eating. You can see the obvious dominance there. Here are some ideas for you... KEEPING CATS FROM EATING EACH OTHERS FOOD I feed my cats wet food at night. I feed the slightly overweight cat in one place and my thin cat on a high shelf where she can see the other cat eating. During the day, I feed my overweight cat using an interactive feeder, so she has to use her natural instincts to work for her food. I give my skinny cat a small bowl of dry food on another shelf, so she can graze. Its not that my overweight cat cant get to the other food, but she is content to eat her easier-to-get food. Each morning, I also feed my skinny cat dry food in our closet, which is at the end of our walk-in bathroom. So there is quite a buffer from the bathroom door. I turn on the fan, so the other cat (who is closed out) cannot hear my skinny cat crunching. The things we do for our cats! I also sneak my skinny cat treats now and then. CATS EATING DOG FOOD This is a real problem for inside cats. You have to stop this. Even though your cats may be healthy now, eating dog food will make any cat overweight and unhealthy. I have volunteered at an animal shelter for many years and have seen this problem over and over again with overweight cats given to the shelter. Feed your dog at times you can supervise and take up the bowl when your dog is finished. If you kennel your dog, feed him in his kennel, so the cats cant get to the food. CAN CATS EAT VEGAN FOOD This is the most difficult part of your question because I can tell you have strong convictions in this area. However, I must tell you that cats should not ever be on a vegan diet. I am very sorry. I know this is difficult to hear. Cats were built to be obligate carnivores. They must have the taurine from the meat because they cannot produce it on their own, like dogs can. I know some vegan pet foods have synthetic taurine, but I wouldnt chance this. It is just not the same. Cats on a vegan diet will likely have severe medical conditions. See the quote below from Pet WebMD If allowed to continue long enough, these dietary problems can lead to serious and sometimes irreversible medical conditions. The one veterinarians mention most often is taurine-related dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart with weak contractions and poor pumping ability). Low taurine can also lead to reproductive failures, growth failures, and eye problems. I hope this helps and at least gives you some ideas. I wish you and your animal family the best!\n",

Some are actively vicious and will attack snails and eat them. Others are totally fine around snails or particular types of snails. It also seemed like some of the cases were similar to yours, in which the betta seemed to live peacefully with the snail for a while, but then suddenly the snail was gone (in that case though, I believe the snail might have been sick and the betta only ate it when it was close to being dead.) In short, yes, bettas can attack and eat snails, but they dont always do so.\n",

            "#> are tiger barbs compatible with tetras?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.9 \t\t No. Definitely not at the moment, but possibly later on down the road. I assume this is the same tank you ask about here and here. This is a new tank that does not have an established biofilter yet: this means the more fish you put in now, the more unhealthy the water will get. Until you know for a fact that your biofilter is working -- your ammonia and nitrite levels stay at 0ppm and do not fluctuate -- there is no point in adding any more fish. If you do, the most likely result is that theyll die, or suffer permanent damage to their gills that greatly shortens their life. But can you add tetras once the biofilter is working? The answer to that is maybe. There are dozens of species of tetra out there. I dont know whats available to you or what kind of fish youre looking for, so Im not going to make a specific recommendation. But basically, you need to ask two questions to decide whether you can keep fish together: how will they interact with each other? And, can I provide environmental conditions that are healthy for both species? In terms of behavioral compatibility, tiger barbs are active, somewhat aggressive fish. Ive even heard some people say they dont believe theyre suited for a community tank at all. As Seriously Fish notes: P. tetrazona is notorious as an aggressive community inhabitant with a reputation for nipping the fins of tankmates though this behaviour only tends to be pronounced when insufficient numbers are purchased or space is limited... That said it is relatively boisterous and doesn’t make an ideal companion for very shy, slow-moving, or long-finned fishes such as many livebearers, cichlids, and anabantoids. Tetras are often relatively shy, so in your research youll want to make sure a species can handle being pushed around a bit. The flip side is that there are very few tetra species that will cause problems for the barbs. And as the SF article mentions, youd want an active, short-finned species. In terms of environmental compatibility, it looks like tiger barbs and most tetras prefer slightly acidic, soft water, so thats a plus. The SF article mentions the barbs come from clearwater streams and rivers with a sandy bottom and thick vegetation, with temperatures in the mid-20s (°C)/mid-70s (°F). I would rule out the tetras native to blackwater conditions, where the water is still and warm, dark with tannins, with little live vegetation, but there are still plenty of species to choose from. So thats what would help you pick out a tetra thats compatible in terms of water conditions and behavior. But theres another aspect to environmental compatibility: once you know what the fish need, can you provide it? The biggest limiting factor here is your tank size. Tiger barbs and most tetras are highly social and are best kept in large groups, which means you would need a good amount of tank space and filtration capacity. I dont think Ive seen you mention anywhere how large your tank is. The four barbs you have will get pretty large -- 3 (7.5 cm) or so. If you have a small tank, like a 10 gallon (38 liters), you probably dont have room for any more fish. Finally, consider alternatives as well. The barbs will spend most of their time in the middle of the water column. You can avoid a lot of aggression problems by choosing tankmates that stay towards the bottom -- I think loaches are common tankmate, for example.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.2 \t\t Serpae tetras are by nature fin nippers. They are only second to tiger barbs. Although I always wanted to have them again, I restrained myself knowing what they are capable of. It is just their nature. The docile Neon tetras can become aggressive to each other if you have fewer than half a dozen of them. Ive seen aggression in Neons in my small 5 gallon tank where I kept 1 betta, 4 neons, 1 cory and 2 black neons. The aggression stopped when I add 2 more neons. My 5 gallon tank is mainly just for the betta and the tetras are just tank mates. Bottom line, if a normally docile neon tetra becomes aggressive with few numbers how much more to a naturally aggressive Serpae. Mind you my neon tetras came from a larger population in my larger tank.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.9 \t\t Tiger barb prefer a well-planted aquarium, that would imitate their original environment. Tetras, in general, also like some plants to hide them from the light. Since there are so many specimens of plants, with so many shapes, sizes, densities... I think the best way to measure how much plants you could have would have to take into account all these characteristics. What I would recommend would be high, floating plants, covering 30% of the surface of the aquarium. And planted plants to cover about 20% to 30% of the area of the front of the aquarium.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 22.9 \t\t The domestication of cats was a multi-step process like that of the dog coming from wolves. It seems to have taken place in the Fertile Crescent region of ancient Egypt. The friendliest of the wild cats would make a living by hanging out near human dwellings and killing the rats and mice that they found there. The humans offered additional food as a reward for their service. And so it went. Although domestication was evident about 10,000 years ago, genetic studies show that the wild cats that gave rise to domestic cats branched off from their even wilder brethren about 130,000 years ago. Here is an article DNA research identifies homeland of the domestic cat published in The Guardian in March of 2014 as a reference that will take you through the whole deal.\n",

These humans presumably fed them. Among real feral cats* (having no food supplied by a human) there is additionally death through starvation. Obviously, people with a cat they cant keep should make great efforts to place the cat with new people. It is common for people to think that cats (however much they have been pets) can survive in the wild, but the information we have come across shows that the odds of survival of an individual house-raised cat put in the wild are small. I live in the country, where unwanted cats are sometimes abandoned. I resent the off-loading of now fearful cats, that have no food (people rarely help them, and prey is insufficient) to live on, can become pests probing garbage containers, and are subject to predation by larger animals. Almost all of them suffer a lot. Yes, this is the way of the wild, but we have expected better for pet species. (For free-ranging cats, estimates of the reproductive capacity of female cats and the consequences of unabated reproduction are often extrapolated beyond scientific reliability, as they typically fail to use realis- tic litter sizes or ignore kitten mortality rates, states the AMVA paper. We have developed a great fear of sexual intactness of cats, but that level of fear is not called for in situations of very high mortality of kittens.) Communicating about feral cats is made more difficult when different people mean different things by feral.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.2 \t\t The statistic you cite affects outdoor and feral cats. If youd like to maximize your cats life, bring it—and keep it—indoors. Indoor cats now live an average of 15 years, and it is not uncommon to see cats 18 to 20 years of age. The domestic cat in the wild (sometimes called a feral cat) has a short life expectancy-about 6 years. http://pets.webmd.com/cats/understanding-your-old-aging-cat Do your cats live outside? Or come in and out of the house? If your cat does spend a lot of time exploring the great outdoors, there are some concerns and dangers you should be aware of. A sad statistic is that the average lifespan of an outdoor cat is half as long as an indoor cats. In fact, according to PetPlace.com, it may be more like one-third: 5 years. http://pets.webmd.com/cats/features/how-to-care-for-an-outdoor-cat That said, these are just statistics. I once had an indoor–outdoor cat live over 25 years; she wouldve hated being kept inside. My current cat is too afraid to ever go outside at all unless I take him out on a harness! Do seriously consider allowing the cat into your home, assuming shes game. The more time she spends inside, the longer shell likely live.\n",

Poinsettia has a bad reputation, but there are far more toxic plants that people might use at Christmas, see here https://youshouldgrow.com/are-poinsettias-poisonous-to-cats-dogs/ In regard to children, the taste of the leaves is not pleasant, so they are unlikely to consume a large amount - current estimates suggest that a 50lb child would have to eat 500 leaves to reach a possibly toxic amount. This scenario is obviously highly unlikely, especially with so much chocolate and sweet foods around at Christmas, no child will choose to eat tons of unpleasant tasting poinsettia leaves in preference. Theres probably more risk of harm from a child crashing into the plant and getting the sap on their skin than from eating it, because the sap is irritant to some people. The myth about their extreme toxicity arises from the case of a 2 year old child who consumed one poinsettia leaf, and the childs death was attributed to that, and so this story created an urban myth. The cause of the childs death was apparently unrelated to consumption of the leaf, more info on that and toxicity to humans here https://www.medicinenet.com/are_poinsettia_plants_poisonous_fact_or_fiction/views.htm You might find the following of interest http://www.thepoisongarden.co.uk/atoz/euphorbia_pulcherrima.htm\n",

Before you bring any plant into the house, take a quick look at their website to see if the plant is toxic to your cat (because most plants are): https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants. If you really want to keep the plant, you can try spraying the plant with diluted Cheyenne pepper or hanging the plant somewhere your cat cant jump (although they will almost always find a way). When you make the commitment to bring a cat into your home, you give away a few rights: the right to go to the bathroom by yourself, the right to have tinsel on your Christmas tree or ribbon on your presents, the right to have clothes without cat hair on them, and, yes...the right to have plants inside your house. Regardless of the few things you give up, Im sure you will agree that the friendship and love you get in return is well worth it! Its innate. Cats chew plants. Its really much easier to get rid of the plant. There will be no more getting on to your kitty and no more seeing how much of a bite your cat can get away with before you notice.

            "\t [1] \t\t 27.1 \t\t We had a deaf cat, sadly passed away only about a month ago, and to be honest we didnt handle her any differently than our other cat. The things to bear in mind are: Theyre easier to surprise and every cat might react a little differently if startled, particularly from sleep. Ours just kind of jumped up, but others might be a bit more aggressive. They wont react to shouts or loud noises. We used to clap our hands to get the attention of our cats when they were doing things like clawing furniture. That would usually get them to stop, but that was totally useless with her once she went deaf. At that point wed just pick her up and remove her from the area, which seemed to work. Deaf cats still like attention, grooming, and petting. I found that she became even more of a lap cat once she became deaf, possibly because of getting touch feedback from us. In any event, cats are pretty adaptable and deafness will probably be a minor impediment to them and you. I wouldnt be worried about it, barely something we noticed.\n",

One precaution though, do not let the cat to go outside unattended, as he is far more likely to fall prey to accidents of all sort. Another case is panic; if something startles your cat really badly, he will panic with more lasting effect as hearing cannot tell him if he is being chased etc. so a little sensitivity on the subject is required As John Cavan wrote, deaf cat will be far more likely to be couch cat, as he will be loving sensory input from petting to replace missing sensory input from hearing.\n",

Usually a bacterial infection spreads quicker than the rapid spread of the larvae, and bacterial infection can definitely kill an animal. If your vet has said he/she thinks treatment is the best option for your pup (versus being in too much pain, too much suffering, or too far gone thus suggesting euthanasia) then I would try my best to keep the faith in his educated opinion. Since I dont have pictures, or am able to see a blood panel test, or blood/tissue culture to see what type of infection or bacteria is growing and how the body is reacting- I would suggest IF you are concerned enough you could always get a second opinion from another vet. Subcutaneous infections can get into the bloodstream, spread to the spine, brain, other organs etc. I have seen a dog go blind from Myiasis from the location of where the infestation and infection took place. I would take this seriously either way, no matter the severity, because even if death (as you asked) isnt the outcome, there could be other outcomes that affect your pup forever. I would try your vets treatment plan. You did the right thing by taking him to the vet after topical solutions didnt work.\n",

Over time you may have to have to reapply, but it works. Here is a recipe, but I just use plain baking soda: Using baking soda as a deodorant is a simple way to combat body odor without subjecting your pits to a variety of chemicals. Mix an eighth of a teaspoon of baking soda with a little bit of water — dont dissolve it — and rub it under your arms. You can also create a baking soda and cornstarch mix to fight odor and help prevent wetness. Simply mix one part baking soda with six parts cornstarch and dust a little on your underarms. Shaving you underarms: To get rid of the smell, shaving your underarms can work. But in a pinch this tip may be worthless. Using scented antimicrobial soaps: Soaps such as Tea Tree oil and Peppermint can kill the odour causing bacteria and leave you fresh and clean smelling. Lemon Juice: This may burn if you have any open wounds. You can even use non-sugar lemonade as a cleansing solution. The citric acid in lemon juice can kill odor-causing bacteria, and there are people who swear by the lemon deodorizing method. Jennifer Palmer, chief executive of an organic skincare line, told The New York Times that she swipes her armpits with a sliced lemon on a daily basis. Just be sure not to apply lemon juice to recently shaven armpits — ouch! Rubbing Alcohol: All these methods I use and they are cheap. The alcohol may burn if applied to fresh shaven arms or wounds. These include hand sanitizers, but make sure the are healthy before applying them to yourself. These really work in a pinch. Rubbing alcohol is another inexpensive and easy deodorant that kills odor-causing bacteria. Simply fill a spray bottle with alcohol and spritz your underarms with it. You can even add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to give it a scent — witch hazel absorbs oil and is mildly astringent, and tea tree oil can help relieve body odor. Just cleaning really quick works. If you bring some soap you can probably wash up real fast, baby wipes and other cleansing solutions ready work wonders. Making solutions out of essential oils work, but make sure you arent allergic. Mixing a peppermint or Tea Tree Oil and water solution works, as well. Additional Info Home-made Deodorant recipes: Tammy Lunas deodorant 1/4 cup baking soda 1/4 cup arrow root powder or corn starch 5 tablespoons coconut oil Combine baking soda and arrow root powder in a bowl and mix with a fork.

            "\t [2] \t\t 15.0 \t\t Limescale can be dissolved by acids. Vinegar essence is a popular cleaning agent because it doesnt leave residues, but it smells quite pungent. Citric acid works just as well and doesnt smell. Do use diluted pure citric acid rather than lemon juice because juice leaves residues. It can be bought in most drug stores or pharmacies and even as a cooking/baking ingredient in well-sorted supermarkets. Be responsible and safe! Wash your hands after handling acids and take care not to get any into your eyes. Keep out of the reach of children. Plain old sparkling water contains carbonic acid in a low concentration. Its probably the safest detergent of all the listed ones but also the weakest and may take longer or multiple applications to completely clean the humidifier. The more the water fizzes, the better it can dissolve limescale. Do not let the humidifier sit in sparkling water for a whole day, because as soon as it stops fizzing, the carbonic acid is gone and the mineralized water itself builds even more limescale.

            "\t [1] \t\t 21.7 \t\t You should lubricate the hinge and doorknob mechanism with oil. GT-85 or other teflon-containing lubricants are the best. If youre not in a position to do that: WikiHow: Take light, slow steps as you are opening the door. That way, no one will hear the squeak of the floorboards and/or tile as you enter the room. Be careful when turning the doorknob because some doorknobs can be very noisy as you turn and let go. If it is noisy, turn very slowly and let go slowly, only releasing when it is back in its original position. Turn the doorknob so that the least rotation is needed. If the hinges are on the right, rotate the doorknob clockwise. If the hinges are on the left, rotate the doorknob counterclockwise. This holds true whether the door opens toward you or away from you. After you turn the doorknob, press the door upward and then toward the hinges in rapid succession as you open the door. This will help to reduce the noise the door makes as it separates from the jamb. Jamming the door upward and toward the hinges immobilizes it and makes the chance of squeaking unlikely. Additional Info Some people say spit on the hinges. Doors are sticky and noisy when opened? For obstructions near the door. sand down or strip the offending parts until they clear each other without touching (and possibly repaint with a single coat if you need to).

If theres a way to run a fan so it pushes air through and out the garage, do so - open a window in the house, open the garage door, put a box fan in the door between the garage and the house. 2) Clean and deodorize whats in the garage.

Walking front-first is a lot better (now it depends on the house: on the concrete floor, you should be inaudible, wood might still be problematic). Opening doors: push/pull it shut before pushing down the handle / turning the knob. That way theres no stress on the catch and no sudden bumping when the door is released. Closing doors: the same, turn the knob / push the handle down before closing the door. push/pull it completely shut and keep it there while releasing the knob/handle. I assume you have the kitchen door closed already when pushing the microwave buttons. No good solutions from me for the rest :( [EDIT:] okay, no kitchen door.

            "\t [1] \t\t 22.8 \t\t Yes there are different plugs for different engines. Usually you need the engine model on your mower, and take in the old spark plug to the hardware store. Ask for someone to help you find the right spark plug and tell them your engine model and mower model. Usually near the spark plugs at the store there is a booklet showing your old model of spark plug and what model the brand in front of you is compatible with. If not, someone behind the counter might have that book. They get used and abused a lot.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.3 \t\t Before you start doing anything on your mower disconnect the spark plug wire and make sure its away from the spark plug so the engine doesnt accidentally start if you turn the blades. Think of how old prop planes were started by turning the prop. On lawnmowers Ive used and seen there spark plug has always been either on the front or back but tipping it forward or backward doesnt leave it in the most stable position to clean it. Your manual states Hose under deck by tilting the mower so that the spark plug is up. That would indicate you remove the bag and tip it backwards so the handle is touching the ground. If you tip it so the spark plug is down oil can get to the spark plug and foul it. Many times I tip it to the side, I used to have a mower with the spark plug in the back, because its more stable that way in some cases and if the spark plug is pretty much center front or back the spark plug doesnt get oil on it. I make sure the air filter and muffler (usually on same side for mowers Ive used) are pointing up. Dont want oil flowing into the carburetor or air box. One old mower I had years ago would leak oil out of the muffler if tipped on that side and then smoke up the next time it was used.

The term pot-ash originally applied to the substance left behind after soaking ashes from burnt plants in a pot with water - after evaporation, any white coating round the pot was potash and used as such. The sort of potash most commonly used by gardeners is Sulphate of Potash, which is created chemically, and its used primarily around fruiting plants.

Heres an insightful link about the topic with pictures. It explains how they still had the problem after using shade cloth. The link talks about calcium deficiency, but it should be noted that blossom end rot can still occur when theres enough calcium in the soil. The problem does have to do with calcium, however. Both problems usually just affected bell-type peppers and large peppers, in 2016, on my fruits. I recommend picking them as soon as it starts to happen—so more peppers can grow and so it doesnt spread over a larger portion of the affected fruit.\n",
            "#> how moist should compost be?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.3 \t\t Below are a few more sites that contain a lot of good composting information that you may find helpful/useful: Composting Council of Canada At Home With Compost: Clues on Composting The composter contents should be moist like a wrung-out sponge. If the contents are too dry, it will take overly long to compost; and if too wet, the contents may begin to smell. Troubleshooting If the pile does not decrease in size or generate heat, composting may need a boost. If the pile is dry, add water - mixing thoroughly. If the pile is wet and muddy, spread it in the sun and add dry material. Remember to save old compost to mix with incoming material. Create Your Own Compost Pile Having the right amount of greens, browns, and water is important for compost development. Ideally, your compost pile should have an equal amount of browns to greens and alternate layers of organic materials of different-size particles. The brown materials provide carbon for your compost and the green materials provide nitrogen, while the water provides moisture to help breakdown the organic matter. Backyard Composting Approach One 1 - Select a dry, shady spot near a water source for your compost pile or bin. 3 - Moisten dry materials as they are added. 5 - Optional: Cover top of compost with a tarp to keep it moist. Backyard Composting Approach Two 6 - Top with a 3-inch layer of brown materials, adding water until moist. 7 - Turn your compost pile every week or two with a pitchfork to distribute air and moisture. Move the dry materials from the edges into the middle of the pile. Continue this practice until the pile does not re-heat much after turning. Making and Using Compost Location Because the compost pile may need to be kept moist during dry weather, a convenient source of water should be available. But don’t locate the pile where water may stand. Excess moisture in the bottom of the pile can cause the process to stop or lead to odor problems. Layering Lightly water each layer as it is added. The entire pile should be as wet as a well-wrung sponge. Achieving this result is easier if you water each layer of dry material while building the pile rather than trying to wet the entire pile after it is built. Care of the pile Decomposition will occur even if a compost pile is ignored after it has been built, but it will occur at a slower rate. Adding water to maintain moist conditions and turning the pile to improve aeration will speed the process. To check the moisture content of the pile, squeeze a handful of compost. If a few drops of water can be squeezed out, moisture is about right. If no drops fall, the pile is too dry. If water trickles out, the pile is too wet. Cover the pile with plastic or other materials during wet weather to avoid excessive moisture buildup. Piles may be turned by slicing through them with a spade and turning over each slice. The main objectives of turning are to aerate the pile and to shift materials from the outside closer to the center, where they may also be heated and decomposed. Moisten dry spots in the pile by spraying with water during turning. US Composting Council\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.4 \t\t Yes, compost needs water but not too much. It should have the same amount of dampness as a wrung out sponge. And it needs to be tilled and turned over every once in a while to keep it aerated; that will help prevent mildew from forming.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.3 \t\t If you cant do traditional thermophilic composting, several other forms of composting are easy to do indoors or with limited outdoor space. The one that seems most accessible is worm composting or vermicomposting. In all composting systems, its the beneficial bacteria, arthropods and nematodes who do the actual work of breaking the material down and making the nutrients plant available. The same is true for worm-composting, that the bacteria is doing most of the work, but the worms then eat the bacteria and super-charge the resulting castings (worm poop) with even more powerful microbes to help your plants. Materials and process: one of a few specific breeds of worms, with red wigglers being the most common variety but european night crawlers can work too. a container, such as a 15 gallon plastic tub. Drill holes in the sides, bottom, and top. some bedding, like newspaper, coconut coir, and/or leaves. The bedding should be wet thoroughly when starting the bin. It should feel as moist as a wrung-out sponge. chop food to no more than 1-2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) and add it to the bin. Worms seem to really like especially melons, coffee grounds, Keep out certain foods like: meat/bone/dairy, citrus, acidic foods, foods high in sugar/oils, heavily processed foods, potatoes, weed seeds, anything that might have an herbicide or insecticide. When in doubt, use a search engine can I put X in my worm bin is commonly found in the search history of worm composters! Add water to keep it moist. The worms will tell you they want less water by crawling to the top of the bin or they want more water by crawling down to the bottom where its usually more moist. Feed periodically by choosing a section of the bin you havent put food into for a while, opening up a hole in the material, and burying the new food into that hole. Burying the food helps worms enjoy it all without being scared by light, reduces odors, and prevents small flies from finding the food. The worms will adapt to the surface area and amount of food you give them. If you see lots of food in the bin when you go to feed then you should slow down your feeding a little. If youre doing everything right it wont smell and the worms wont escape, so you can keep the bin in a closet, under a sink, under your bed, etc. Harvesting the castings: A simple technique with few tool requirements is to just put handfuls of well processed material from your bin onto a surface like a cutting board. On a sunny day take it outside or put it under a light - the worms dont like light and will crawl down. After setting the pile down wait a few minutes for worms to go down. Then pluck the top 1/2 inch (1.5cm) of material off the pile and set aside. Wait 5 minutes for worms to crawl down and repeat until you have just worms at the bottom of the pile and can put them back into the bin. The material you took off the top can be further separated: big pieces go back in the bin, the smallest material you plucked off the top of the pile is the worm castings. A method with less work but that requires tools is to get hardware cloth which is a grid of 1/8 inch (30mm) metal wire. Hardware cloth is usually sold in big rolls, but Ive used this technique with a piece as small as 2feet square. Place your processed castings from your bin onto the grid, a few handfuls at a time. Jiggle the hardware cloth back and forth so the castings (and some worms) will fall through into a wheelbarrow or tarp or other catching device underneath. The bigger chunks of material left on top can go back into the worm bin along with any worms and cocoons that may have fallen through to the bottom. Using the castings: Once youve separated the castings from the worms and the bedding, you can use it in a few ways. To use outdoors, just work the castings into the soil. A small amount goes a long way, so use a little casting mixed in near each plant. To use castings indoors as a soil amendment in pots you should first let it dry out so that you are sure all the worms are dead (you dont want them crawling out of the pot). Then just work a little bit of castings into the top of the pot soil or mix it in when planting or up-potting. You can make a great foliar treatment/compost tea from castings (though the steps are too many to go into here). This helps reduce disease and insect issues.\n",

Allow to dry. When harvesting any peppers just wash well. Id also spray some of that mixture on top of the soil, shallowly. If this plant is in a large heavy pot, just get a good sprayer, fill with properly mixed neem, go out side on the patio at night, lay the plant on its side (use newspaper to be tidy) and spray the plant thoroughly, especially the undersides of the leaves, the stems.

            "\t [2] \t\t 23.1 \t\t The burnt/scorched looking leaves could mean a lot of things. My first guess would be over fertilization either at the nursery or by you. Blueberries need acidic soil at a pH level of about 4.5-5. If you used a regular high nitrogen fertilizer, it would be terrible for the plant and the leaves can get burnt from the fertilizer. Secondly, blueberries like well drained soils. They have very shallow root systems and stagnant water can also lead to discoloration of the leaves, although this is usually deep reddish-brown (like fall colors), and seldom have a burnt appearance. However, I wont rule this out. Since you said that it was heavily rootbound, it is very likely that the water wasnt draining away fully. I explain a bit more about this and how to increase soil pH for blueberries in this answer Unfortunately, reddish leaves are also a symptom for underwatering! From Mike Perrys answer to my question on boysenberries Below quote comes from Growing Small Fruits for the Home Garden: Watering Lack of supplemental watering from June to August severely limits successful production of blueberries in the Pacific Northwest. Shallow-rooted plants require close attention to maintain a uniformly moist environment around their base. They require 1, or possibly 2 inches of water each week, in the absence of any rainfall. Be sure the entire root zone is wet after an irrigation. Drought symptoms include reddened foliage, weak, thin shoots, and reduced fruit set. Maintain a 2-inch mulch layer to preserve soil moisture. Also see the scientific reason in Mikes answer, although Im not sure if that applies to blueberries too. Lastly, it could be something as simple as sun scorching. If the nursery was in a place that had long periods of direct, intense sunlight every day, it could have scorched the leaves. This happened to my raspberries and the advice there was to use a sun shading fabric. In any case, from your description, the plant seems to be doing well in your garden, so you probably are doing things right. :)\n",

They will grow very well in shade, if they are not under another trees dripline, and if there arent many other tree roots in the soil. Under a dripline, and in dense rooted ground, a spruce will grow much slower (sometimes less than 6 a year), and will perhaps not have the pencil straight trunk that is easy to achieve in full sun. Fertilizing can help with that. In the shade, Blue spruces do not lose color, but the branching habit will tend to be lighter, more airy. And the tree may have a taller, thinner growth habit. I actually like to work with these better. Below are pictured some 15 year old blue spruce that only receive 3 hours of direct sun per day.

            "\t [2] \t\t 23.3 \t\t I live in a region where Norway spruce grows wild, and in my experience, the lower shaded branches shedding their needles and dying is perfectly normal for these trees. For the tree, theres no point in keeping these branches alive when the same energy and nutrients can instead be directed towards the upper branches that receive more sunlight. Heres a nice example picture from Wikimedia Commons: (Image by Wikimedia Commons user Beentree, CC-By-SA 3.0) Unlike Scots pines, which are also common here, spruce trees dont usually shed the dead branches by themselves. Instead, the branches will dry up but remain attached to the tree unless something (like a passing human or an animal) breaks them off — which is easier said than done, as even the dry branches are still quite tough and prickly and firmly attached to the trunk. I suspect this may even be a deliberate evolutionary defense mechanism to protect the trunk of the tree. Anyway, as long as the rest of the tree appears healthy, I see no cause for concern here. As already noted by Bamboo, the dead branches will not grow back. (If theyre only almost dead, they might still revive if exposed to more sunlight, but even then only the new growth at the tips will have needles.) If you find them unsightly, you can cut them off, but its also perfectly fine to let them be. Either way, if you trim back the shrubs shading the base of the tree and let it grow, youll likely find that the upper, still live branches will gradually bend down as they grow out, resulting in a layer of live green branches that will eventually hide the base of the tree from sight. But this is likely to take years if not decades.\n",

This makes the tree look unbalanced if you do more than the bottom fifth of the tree. You can garden in pots under the trees. This keeps the spruce from stealing all the water. You can try ground covers, but you will need to water them. Bugle weed, bishops weed, astilbe, may work under there.

Both were also used in Europe in the past, arugula as cultivated species, and Diplotaxis as wild species, where available. (so the contrary of what we think). So speed of growth is the determinant, for commercial use. Additionally, both (like many other vegetables) are a lot less healthy that we think (still healthy anyway): to be able to commercialize, selections removed the more strong/bitter varieties (which were healthier).

But I would check pots for plants (and possibly for vegetables): colours (pigments) may contains some heavy metal (which gives the colour). Plant pots tend to mantain the colour, so they are safe. Other plastic recipients tend to lose colours. In any case, most of recipients (also clay) should work well. Check that they have natural colours and more traditional forms (the others could have more dangerous materials, especially for artistic pots). Choose material that will endure (so less emission of material). Soils contains also metals, and small quantities are not dangerous (in effect we need some of them). I would assume you will not eat only from the plants on your pot, and probably your soil would be much better (more organic, so few metals).

The glass will help in that you can easily see roots. You should see a main thick brownish tap root curled around the bottom of the jar and possibly a lot of very fine white roots. If there are a lot of roots then the plant possibly has outgrown the soil in which it is living. As the plant grew, the roots had somewhere to explore for new resources, and while there was soil free of roots there was a buffer to take up excess water and supply this when the plant went dry. With the jar fully occupied there was no buffer and the now much larger leaf area had no water and dried out, leading to the brown patches. The task now is to remove the plant from the jar without doing too much damage to the roots which must be left as intact as possible.

Although the standard advice is to leave them in the ground until after the first frosts, Ive found that when I do this, they become woody, like yours, and are tunneled by carrot fly. Ive now started lifting both carrots and parsnips in mid-Autumn and, although the parsnips are not quite as sweet, they are not at all woody, and carrot-fly damage is minimal. Their over-large size is probably down to the horse manure, resulting in an over-fertile soil coupled with their prolonged stay in the ground.

This will give you insurance in case/when the mother plant dies due to the cold. As for the rest of the succulents, unless theyre used to the cold temperatures that youll be experiencing, they stand a good chance of dying as well. Assuming that the evergreens are not tropical species (like Norfolk Island Pine), then they will probably be fine outside on the balcony.

This may be tricky, given your climate If frozen, mulch the heck out of them with straw. The intent is to keep the pots frozen through the winter so that they do not experience frost-heaving, which has the potential to break the roots and kill the plants. Remove the mulch in spring. If you cant get the pots to freeze solid, then youll have to come up with a way to prevent them from warming too much, especially on sunny days. Perhaps a shade screen? Burlap/muslim covering of the plants and pots? I dont know that the bubble wrap by itself is a good idea, because it is clear and will allow sunshine to heat the plants/soil. Perhaps use the bubble wrap underneath the burlap/muslim wraps? In any case, water the evergreens well now and when the weather warms in spring. Try to keep the soil as moist as possible, as any winter warmth may cause the roots to use the water in the pots, and if there isnt enough water there the evergreens will brown.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 24.3 \t\t Anchors for booster seats are only for convenience, not for safety. In actuality, the LATCH system, as mandated in US vehicles from 2002 onward, supports a total combined weight of both child and seat of no more than 65 pounds. I found this information on Consumer Reports. Depending on the weight of your car seat or booster seat, this may mean the LATCH system only supports children weighing anywhere from 32-50 pounds. In these cases, its necessarily safer to use the seat belts to secure the seat, rather than the LATCH system. The reason LATCH was developed was not because it is inherently safer, but because its inherently easier to secure the seats properly. Securing seats properly with the seat belt straps is more difficult, so more care must be taken in doing so. However, seat belts do not have the surprisingly low maximum supported weight that LATCH systems do. Seat belts are designed to safely secure adult passengers of various weights. For most five-point harness seats, its also possible to secure them with the seat belt, instead of the anchors. Booster seats that only use the seat belt to secure the child, and dont secure the seat, gain no additional safety benefit from the LATCH system.

So with the seatbelt holding the child, if the car came to an instant halt, the booster would effectively hit the child at 70mph in the back of the knees. (Yes I know this is a huge simplification, but it shows the principle) With the booster anchored as well, it will decelerate at the same rate as the child, so this impact will not occur.

            "#> are baby stimulation videos good?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.7 \t\t There are several reasons not to do that: Infants have very simple minds that can easily be overloaded by too much information. A psychedelic, high-contrast video can do more harm than good. Infants develop best, if more/all senses are used together. That is why those famous toys you hang over their beds look funny, play music and are in range for the toddler to touch. A simple video is a very poor choice for stimulation and learning. A video is 2D and will not help (or might even hinder) 3D recognition. Under normal circumstances an hour in a park (or nature if you happen have some around) is one of the best things to do if you want to stimulate your infants senses. Let him see the scene, touch things, listen to the sound of nature, smell flowers and taste (some ;)) things. Then grant him/her time to sleep so his/her brain can process the information.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.2 \t\t Some of the other answers seem to address older children. Im focusing on infants as per the question. Yes, TV is harmful to an infant because it overstimulates. A TV screen is very active. This fast-paced activity should be avoided so as to not overload the mental processing capacity of the infant. While youre right that moving patterns and sounds are good stimulation for infants, such inputs need to be much slower than what a TV provides. We adults dont really notice the fast pace because we can follow whats going on and it makes sense to us. But if you cant follow it, then its putting quite some strain on you. Theres a constant flood of light and dark flashes, fast movements, transitions and cuts between perspectives and scenes. If you look at your screen out of the corner of the eye, youll get an idea of this - Or walk into a TV store... its too hectic! Also, it doesnt have to be Rambo; even a relatively calm show like the evening news has lots of multi-camera action. So I would avoid putting an infant in a position where she can see the TV screen, even partially or in the corner of the eye. Place the baby facing away from the screen (facing you!) instead. Good visual stimulation for infants can be provided using mobiles that hang above their crib. Infants only have black/white vision the first 6 months, so the mobiles need to have distinct shapes and contrasting patterns (dots, spirals, lines, etc.). Later, colors are important too.\n",

Various studies do show that TV is not a good replacement for real interaction, but depending on what was shown, there will still have been stimulation. There are many programmes specifically designed to help babies. In any case, however, what you can do now is spend time talking and playing with your daughter. Interact with her to give her the input and feedback a TV doesnt give. If you are worried at all, your pediatrician should check how your daughter is doing against learning milestones. We have a fair bit of info here on the site on expected milestones, and how the timelines are very broad - some children get to some of them faster than others.

            "#> do booster seats need to be bolted in?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 19.0 \t\t With car seats for younger children (infants or toddlers), there are straps which hold the child into the car seat and then an additional system to secure the seat to the car. This used to be with a regular seat belt, but in modern vehicles is more commonly with LATCH. (Having once fed a seat belt through a toddler seat in a car without LATCH, its quite obvious that the LATCH system was a terrific innovation for its ease of use.) In contrast, the child is being restrained by the cars seatbelt when sitting in a booster seat. A booster seat is a firm cushion of foam or plastic that raises the child higher in the car to improve the position and angle of the shoulder belt. Source Booster seats are a type of child restraint that do not have a five-point harness system, but rather rely on the vehicle seat belt system to keep your child restrained. The booster seat elevates your child so that the vehicle seat belt is positioned properly over your child. Booster seats should be used in the rear vehicle seat with a lap and shoulder seat belt system, never a lap belt-only. Source (emphasis mine) The LATCH connection for the seat you have isnt providing any additional restraint -- imagine your child sitting it in without a seatbelt, its just as easy to fall forward in the case of an accident whether the seat is secured to the car or not. The key thing is to make sure the booster seat is is used with both a lap and shoulder belt. I would personally purchase an additional (LATCH-less) booster seat for the babysitters car, so its always there and you wont ever have the problem of forgetting to transfer the seat. We actually own four booster seats for two kids, to cover a range of possible transportation situations -- the extra set purchased after one frustrating week where we forgot to transfer seats every single day.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 18.8 \t\t Do I need a seat belt extender? No. You would only really need this if your cars seat belts arent long enough to accommodate your son in the booster seat. Otherwise, if it works fine without then do without -- its one less failure point. Can I tell if my son fits in the booster seat safely just by looking at him? No. You can check the operating instructions to see whether there are precise illustrations of where the straps should be (especially in the shoulder/neck area). But if you want to be really safe, visit your regions automobile association and have them look at your sons seated position. In practicality, if you only need this during a vacation stay, then Ill revise my above answers to no, and yes.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 18.5 \t\t If they are old enough to use a booster seat but you cant fit one in, have a look at seat belt adjusters. I got an Autosafe one for my youngest and it makes a difference. Admittedly we could always fit three car seats in, but it was a squeeze and we had to move them a bit to buckle all three in. The adjuster just brings the shoulder part of the belt down to an appropriate level: Check out the website for more info. Obviously this isnt a suitable alternative for seats for younger kids, as they need the head/neck support as well.\n",
            "#> can you travel by car with a 1 month old baby?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.1 \t\t The major reason not to travel with a newborn (< 3 month old) is not so much the carseat, but the immune system. A baby under three months old does not have a very well developed immune system, and so traveling to another location (particularly to be around new people) increases the risks that he/she catch an infection which is potentially much more dangerous to a very young baby than it would be over three months of age. (Yes, location matters - you can catch things from people, OR from the environment, and even if it is a person to person disease, youre more likely to be able to control things in your own home.) However, if you need to travel for whatever reason, one and a half hours should be fine. This list is a good list to start from with regards to road travel; you will want to pay attention to #5 and #6 for this short of a trip. Sun protection is a must, but at < 3 months old you cannot use any sort of sunscreen, so instead you need to have clothing covering as much as possible, and a sunshade on BOTH windows in the rear seat plus the rear window (the far window can still allow in a lot of sun at certain times of day, unless you live in the mountains). A mirror is also highly recommended so you can check on baby without pulling over (as long as youre able to keep your checks to safe times and durations). In terms of stops, this article recommends stopping every hour unless the baby is asleep, and trying to keep to his/her regular feeding schedule. I would guess 1.5 hours is still fine for going without a stop, but I wouldnt go much over that.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.3 \t\t @anongoodnurses answer is great, but I want to add some things from personal observation: I have flown with a baby as young as 4 months, and it was not an issue. The younger the baby is the easier, since they sleep more. I think a 7 week baby will be fine (provided no health issues, not pre-mature and so forth). ask you pediatrician if there is any vaccinations he would give earlier ( I think we had an 8 week appointment, s/he might want to do those vaccinations earlier) I have never been in trouble nursing on planes. I have flown with Delta, KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways, Virgin America and Alaskan. I never covered up. If you dont nurse, you can bring milk/food for your baby that is over 3 oz/100 ml through the security checkpoint (in US and most countries), but you must be travelling with the baby, and you have to be able to open the container. I have heard of people being asked to drink it, but they should have a chemical checker thing they wave around above it. I would recommend buying a seat for children over age 1 if you travel more than 4 hours. For Infants you will mostly want to hold them, though it is SAFER to have them in an airline approved car seat. In the US, the airlines does NOT provide you with an infant seatbelt (which attached to your own) in my experience. I have only seen this flying in Europe. If you bring a car seat, be SURE it is approved by FAA when travelling in the US. If you travel internationally, be SURE it is approved by the air travel authority in the carriers home country (for instance, British Airways did not care one bit if our car seat had an FAA approved sticker on - luckily it was still appropriate). If you dont buy a seat, you still need a ticket for the baby. Adding: Some 3rd party websites does not allow you to purchase lap infant tickets. Some carrier websites does not allow it either. Best bet is to book by phone directly from carrier. (I have not tried booking lap infant tickets from a non-online travel agency). Flying domestically in the US a lap infant (under 2) is usually free. Flying internationally most times I have paid 10% of ticket price (and got an extra 10lbs bag allowance for checked bags) for lap infants. You can use the birth certificate as ID if you fly domestically for the TSA check if your baby doesnt have a passport. You need a passport flying internationally regardless of the age. All airlines I have been with allowed me to bring a carseat and a stroller for free. Even if I did not bring the carseat on the plane, we have been needing them at the destination, and have much preferred this to renting. For strollers, most airplanes/airports allow you go gate check the strollers, that way you can have your baby in the stroller all the way to the gate, and will get the stroller back at the gate too at your destination/ I have not been in the US airport that did not do this, but I have been in international ones where you had to pick up the stroller at the luggage. Car seats/stroller (not gate checked) will sometimes need to checked in/retrieved at the odd size luggage counter, it depends on the airport. Bring multiple changes of clothes for the baby, and if possible a change for you, in your hand luggage. First time baby 1 had a poop explosion was on an airplane... on that note: bring twice as many diapers as you think you need in your hand luggage. Especially if you have a stop over - we got delayed in London for a day with a 3.5 year and a 13 months old, I was glad we had packed lots of diapers in our carry ons!\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.2 \t\t My daughter screamed in the car seat from about 1 month old until about 4 months old. She could not fall asleep in the car seat due to her Moro reflex. So if I attempted to drive anywhere during nap time she would get overtired and scream. In retrospect a product like the Swaddle Me which allows for swaddling while in a harness safely would have helped that situation. Whenever a newborn is not sleeping he or she is usually hungry, so if I attempted to drive my daughter when she was not tired she would be crying because she was hungry. It was pretty miserable. At 4 months she was old enough to be awake at times when she wasnt hungry as well as old enough to grasp and mouth toys. She was also old enough that her Moro reflex had diminished to the point that she could sleep unswaddled. So at 4 months I could either hand her a toy to play with on a short car trip or get her to sleep for a long one. At that point things got significantly better. As a 1 year old my daughter still complains in the car seat if she is hungry and does not have a snack, but other than that she can be content.\n",

However, Seventh Generation responded by saying that they use existing test data which was received when they licensed their products to another company. They didnt directly contribute or commissioned any of their own tests. (So its as if the other companies wanted assurance of animal testing, and then provided test results to Seventh Generation for reference.) You can also use natural laundry detergents from Etsy (just a random one I found). These have the benefit of being simple (no fragrances, additives, etc.) and are not necessarily more expensive to use. The downside, of course, is that if youre out - and didnt order more - you got to go get something else from the store! You can also make your own laundry detergent.

            "\t [2] \t\t 14.7 \t\t NO It is not much known from the wildlife of this kind of hamster. They are called winter white, because this kind has the whole year the color of the wild animals winter fur. In the wild there were very rare observations of pairs, and colonies only for the winters time, to warm each other. In conclusion, they can live peacefully together for some time (one winter long), but within hours this could change and will not change back! If you are willing and able to separate them at this point, then yes, you can start with them as group. But be aware, that the big trouble could start in the night, or when you are not at home, and it will be a risk for the health (and maybe life) of your hamsters. In the past, a lot of sources said white Russian dwarf hamster are the best to keep in pairs or colonies and this is copy-pasted in near uncounted way in the internet now. There is much less research about this, only long-year owners, who tried and failed in nearly every cage-size. And real research is made for animal testing companies, because this kind of hamster is used for such tests too. This research gets the result, that it is not even animal friendly at the least (because these companies will not do more effort than to fulfill minimal requirements in most cases) to let them live in groups. (Even it would be less expensive for the companies). SO please, do them a favor and let them have their own space each! They would be happier, healthier and you would have less worries about them. (My source, a German website of long-term-owners, with detailed description of their experience to try with different groups (male, female, siblings), different cages (type, size, count of houses, count of food-places) hamsterinfo.de. The mentioned facts I let translate by a software is this (please notice, that Djungarian is the misleading translation of German Dsungarischer Zwerghamster, which is the winter white dwarf hamster): Djungarian hamsters - group animals or solitary animals? A few years ago, when we began to love hamsters, there was no question about it. Many agreed that Djungarian dwarf hamsters should be kept in groups, or at least in pairs. It was a huge mistake that we took this advice to heart. At first it went very well. The dwarf hamsters apparently got along and even kissed each other. Unfortunately, over time we had to find out again and again that dwarf hamsters kept as a pair or in a group suddenly bitten each other very badly without warning (sometimes after a few weeks, sometimes after 1 year). There are now many people who have made the experience - despite optimal housing conditions. Research also confirms this. Unfortunately, there is little good literature on the whole that deals with dwarf hamsters and unfortunately Djungarian dwarf hamsters have not yet been researched in nature. However, there is certainly literature that proves the loneliness of the Djungars. Djungarian hamsters have rarely been observed in pairs. Colonies are never known (such as in guinea pigs, rats, mice, chinchillas). It is only in winter that Djungarian hamsters form colonies even with other mice, but these are immediately dissolved if the temperatures allow it. Therefore, I would like to point out at this point that Djungarian dwarf hamsters should be kept individually. Then theses were voiced that it depends on the size of the cage. Some said you needed a bigger cage, others said that they get along better in small cages. We have tried a lot in our hamster husbandry over the years and have always been taught better. In order to research this phenomenon, we have several groups, each of siblings together. kept in similar and different cages. When rearing young animals, everything went well at first. The males and the older sisters even helped with the rearing. At first everything seemed fine and the dwarf hamsters seemed to be comfortable in the group. After a while this changed suddenly. Not at the same time, but gradually it affected each of the groups. We could not find any differences between males and females. Gradually there were quarrels in the different groups. At that time we did not get too much help, as very few people had this experience at that time, the Djungarian dwarf hamsters were by far not as widespread in pet keeping as they are today. So we had several groups of females and several groups of men. The animals got on very well and because it was very clear in some books and on the Internet at the time that they had to be kept in groups, we thought this form of keeping was the best. The worst experience in all groups was that it came to biting from now on. Some biting was rather harmless with small injuries. Other fights led to the death of a dwarf hamster. The first quarrels began in a group of females after a few weeks. That could still be accepted as a coincidence. We then separated the 4 animals into 2x2 Djungars, but that didnt go well for long either. Little by little it happened in each group. Apparently peaceful animals became little beasts. The last peaceful group were 4 females who got along well for over 1 year, suddenly one of them was bitten so badly that it was bleeding profusely. The whole thing ended in such a way that I had to keep all Djungarian dwarf hamsters individually. In the meantime, many hamster keepers have made this experience and research institutions have also come to the conclusion that Djungarian dwarf hamsters are loners. Nevertheless, there is something in more recent books about keeping these dwarf hamsters in groups, and it is difficult to get just one Djungarian in pet stores. Fortunately, knowledge about these animals is increasing and word of the solitary nature of dwarf hamsters has spread more and more. Not least because of the experience of many owners. Djungarian dwarf hamsters not only avoid each other in the largest hamster home - if they want their territory for themselves - but the stronger defends food and everything else and constantly attacks the weaker, who after a while can no longer defend himself. He lies down on his back (which is a gesture of submission) and is bitten by the other. The weaker would not survive this in the long run. Such a situation would not occur in nature because then the weaker person could flee. Even in the largest cage, however, this is permanent r unfortunately not possible. Not to mention the constant stress that dwarf hamsters are exposed to. Djungarian hamsters need attention, animal-friendly facilities and exercise. The cages offered are often unsuitable, and adequate housing and appropriate accessories are often relatively expensive (like the dwarf hamsters themselves). Djungarian dwarf hamsters have a very cute, bear-like appearance, but are not cuddly animals, they are more suitable for watching than for cuddling, although Djungarian dwarf hamsters, with whom one deals a lot, can also become very trusting. It is not possible to get dwarf hamsters used to each other afterwards. Even if one of the hamsters runs away and wanders around the apartment all night, there is an big quarrel when re-entering the cage. Even then it can happen that the animals have to be separated again. You should definitely not rely on the words of the seller when buying, it is better to inform yourself beforehand. If possible, you should have a home for the dwarf hamster beforehand so that they dont have to endure the fear in the transport box for too long. It is also nice when the hamster can take litter out of its old cage and thus has a familiar smell around it. It is good if dwarf hamsters get the same food at the beginning as in the pet shop. Afterwards you can mix the food with someone else and compose the food of your dwarf hamster yourself or give a different mix of ready-made food.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 22.2 \t\t My suggestion for 1 year old play is to take them outside. Bring them to a park or outside environment every day, in all weather. Let them get dirty, hot and cold, muddy and dusty. This will stimulate their entire body which will stimulate their mind. Outside play also stimulates their immune system letting them encounter bacteria that are abundant and unavoidable. Sunlight produces vitamin D and strengthens their skin and external tissue. Let them express themselves physically. If they fall and get a boo-boo, laugh and soothe them, but dont make a big deal out of it.\n",

Removing naps doesnt help, and moving to earlier wake-up doesnt make much of a difference either. What does help is going outside late in the day. We go almost every day on a walk to the park a block away from after dinner to dark. This is only possible in the summer, of course, but that half hour to hour of outside play gets him to the point that hes ready for bed by 9 rather than 10 or 11, and on days we dont do it (because we go out to dinner, or otherwise are too busy to go to the park) he reverts.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.0 \t\t I dont think a specific amount is really definable, in particular because each child is different. However, the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) endorses Caring for our Children, a set of national standards for childcare environments (ie, daycares). Their recommendation: Outdoor play: Infants (birth to twelve months of age) should be taken outside two to three times per day, as tolerated. There is no recommended duration of infants’ outdoor play. Toddlers (twelve months to three years) and preschoolers (three to six years) should be allowed sixty to ninety total minutes of outdoor play. These outdoor times can be curtailed somewhat during adverse weather conditions in which children may still play safely outdoors for shorter periods, but should increase the time of indoor activity, so the total amount of exercise should remain the same; That sounds about right to me as a minimum; my kids need around an hour to two hours to be happy. But really you should construct your outside time around various external and internal factors, including: Your schedule. If you cant do more than 30 minutes, then do 30 minutes. More is better, but you obviously have to earn a living and feed your child. Your childs preferences. Some children (like mine) are happier with more outside time almost indefinitely; so we try to do an hour every single day, and weekends significantly more (4-6 hours). Make sure they get some, but if they really like it get more. The weather. Your child may benefit more from indoor play when its very cold or otherwise inclement, even in terms of social or gross motor skills. We have a couple of play areas we can go to in the winter (we live in the upper midwest US, so very cold winters, lots of snow) that are very good for their development and let them play more effectively than they could outdoors.\n",

            "\t [3] \t\t 24.5 \t\t With car seats for younger children (infants or toddlers), there are straps which hold the child into the car seat and then an additional system to secure the seat to the car. This used to be with a regular seat belt, but in modern vehicles is more commonly with LATCH. (Having once fed a seat belt through a toddler seat in a car without LATCH, its quite obvious that the LATCH system was a terrific innovation for its ease of use.) In contrast, the child is being restrained by the cars seatbelt when sitting in a booster seat. A booster seat is a firm cushion of foam or plastic that raises the child higher in the car to improve the position and angle of the shoulder belt. Source Booster seats are a type of child restraint that do not have a five-point harness system, but rather rely on the vehicle seat belt system to keep your child restrained. The booster seat elevates your child so that the vehicle seat belt is positioned properly over your child. Booster seats should be used in the rear vehicle seat with a lap and shoulder seat belt system, never a lap belt-only. Source (emphasis mine) The LATCH connection for the seat you have isnt providing any additional restraint -- imagine your child sitting it in without a seatbelt, its just as easy to fall forward in the case of an accident whether the seat is secured to the car or not. The key thing is to make sure the booster seat is is used with both a lap and shoulder belt. I would personally purchase an additional (LATCH-less) booster seat for the babysitters car, so its always there and you wont ever have the problem of forgetting to transfer the seat. We actually own four booster seats for two kids, to cover a range of possible transportation situations -- the extra set purchased after one frustrating week where we forgot to transfer seats every single day.\n",
            "#> what age is best to start karate?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.6 \t\t This is a great article on age and when to starts kids on martial arts. Every style is different, every association is also different. I have found it to be dojo specific. The instructors needs to gear the class for the different age groups as each stage of life has developed certain aspects of ones body and mind. The head instructor in Japan, who teaches goju ryu karate, instructs to kids and adults, however, he doesnt change much, except for fine details, among the two grUops. I am trying to work a kids karate class from 4+ with adults for the beginning portion of the Saturday adult karate class; it is tough. I want to use traditional karate conditioning and warmups, but the average young child less than 9 or so wont find it engaging. If a dojo breaks up the class in 3 or 4 age groups they are more than likely to get a great class for each group then trying to mix them together. Usually from ages below 5 or 6, it is pre-karate; many drills and exercises are just jumping, rolling, kicking, punching, dodging, running...these will help once they begin karate as whatever age. They key with any age is trying different schools and arts, I know some places do not have many, and that makes it challenging.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.5 \t\t The appropriate age depends a great deal on the specific style/art in question, the type of dojo, and the particular child. Most Karate dojos I know take kids starting around age 4-6. Most Krav Maga dojos I know wont take anyone under 14-16; some wont take minors at all. My friends Brazilian Jui-Jitsu dojo only takes kids from age 10, but Im told that most are willing to start younger than that. Assuming an appropriate level of kid-friendliness in the selected dojo, a child is generally ready for martial arts study when he or she: can tell left from right. has developed empathy (meaning specifically that the child groks that others have feelings, and that their behavior can effect others well-being). has developed age-appropriate manners (will wait his/her turn to speak, will listen quietly to an instructor, etc.) has the attention span to give 100% for the length of a class period (typically 30 minutes for small children, to 60 minutes for older children and adults). will (probably with some prompting from parents) reliably practice at least every other day (every day for older children). can take polite criticism in stride, i.e. think heres how I can do this better instead of Im awful and everyone hates me, waaaahhh! What art/style you choose for your child is not nearly as important as what dojo and Sensei you choose. Some dojos just arent set up to teach children well. Others are good with older kids, but lack the special awsomesauce that reaches young students. Here are some traits that make a dojo great for children under 10: Offers family classes where parents and children of varying ages may train together. Has plenty of incremental rewards. Small children cant just look at the change in their body mechanics and know theyve made progress -- they need to be told. While a dojo that uses no displays of ranks, or a simple white/black belt system can be wonderful for adults and mature teens, that is an inadequate level of reinforcement for primary school children. A program well-suited to the youngest students uses patches, colored belts, achievement stripes, a wall chart, a log book, or some other concrete indication to your child when progress has been made. For very young children, there should be some indication of achievement that they can earn at least every 1-2 weeks. This way they know when they have accomplished something, and they internalize that things like focus and practice are good strategies. The sensei uses real (and not-so-real) world examples kids can relate to. We use four fingers in a split-finger eye strike in case we miss slightly, or in the event of attack by a four-eyed monster! The sensei is patient and pays attention to the individual children. The sensei teaches not only martial arts skills, but appropriate lessons on when they should or shouldnt be used. The sensei incorporates games into classes that include small children. Karate dodge ball, jump the noodle, kickpad leapfrog, and so on make learning fun (and give kids a chance to watch the grown-ups in the class look ridiculous). The sensei groups students primarily by rank/progress, so that everyone is challenged at their own level. (This isnt to say that there are no adults only classes, but that a 7th kyu student doesnt experience slowed progress due to being grouped predominantly with 9th kyu age peers.) The dojo community shares values that mesh well with your familys values. This, of course, is all in addition to the things that make a good dojo in general.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.4 \t\t As somebody who has studied several martial arts on and off my whole life (starting at age 10) and also taught adults and kids, heres my opinion. If you just want an activity for them to do, I would say that the minimum is age 6 or 7 -- prior to that, I dont think they have the coordination, attention span, self-discipline, and understanding of the safety issues for themselves and others. However, in my experience, kids who start this young typically do it for a couple years and then lose interest. I know very few adult practitioners who started that young. Most of the best adults I know started as mid-to-late teens or in college. Anecdotal, but Ive seen this trend across several martial arts Ive studied, in various schools. IMHO, starting as a teenager is much more likely to provide them the basis to pursue it for life. That is an extraordinary gift.\n",

            "\t [2] \t\t 21.3 \t\t Imagine what happens in a frontal crash - an unanchored object will continue forwards at the speed it was travelling (say 70mph if we are talking about a UK motorway). So with the seatbelt holding the child, if the car came to an instant halt, the booster would effectively hit the child at 70mph in the back of the knees. (Yes I know this is a huge simplification, but it shows the principle) With the booster anchored as well, it will decelerate at the same rate as the child, so this impact will not occur. Boosters are pretty light, but as kinetic energy is 1/2 x Mass x (Velocity squared) anything you can do to reduce that v-squared really helps.\n",

            "#> can you use pva glue on balsa wood?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.6 \t\t Absolutely. An Elmers-style wood glue (polyvinyl acetate (PVA), generically known as carpenters interior wood glue) is an inexpensive glue which is quite effective for holding balsa wood together. It does not take a lot of wood glue to make a good bond. In fact, too much glue will create a weak joint, so use it sparingly (how to use). If you already have it on hand, wood glue is a perfectly suitable choice. But to be more thorough, when balsa wood is used in applications like model building, joint strength and minimizing weight might become more of an issue. In those cases, cyanoacrylates (super glues) are often a better choice. Glue accelerators are usually mixed with these products to speed cure time in a product that would otherwise be ill-suited to fill spaces (loosely fitted porous materials). There are also polyurethane glues (gorilla glues) and epoxies that have different properties based on the projects needs and application. There are actually a lot of glues which work well with balsa wood, so here is a list of adhesives showing their properties, pros and cons, and their recommended application: Polyvinyl acetate (PVA or White School Glue) Aliphatic (Carpenters Glue, Wood Glue) Cyanoacrylate (CA Glue, Super Glue, Krazy Glue, etc.) Epoxy adhesive Polyurethane Adhesives (Gorilla Glue) Contact Cement Model Airplane Cement (Testors) This list provided courtesy of Diary of a Balsa Goddess\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.9 \t\t Wood glues are fine for balsa. While there are stronger glues, the added strength is usually unnecessary and strong enough should be sufficient. It is hard to generalize but white glues, like Elmers, are just PVA glues that are advertised as craft or general glues. There are also yellow PVA glues, which Elmers also makes (and the one I generally use for my indoor projects), that are geared more towards wood. However there is many similarities between them and in some cases the yellow is just colour added (FYI white vs. yellow is a large debate.). A common adage among wood workers is that the glue joint is stronger than the wood itself and that is true. Also true is that balsa is one of the weakest hardwoods but it is ideal for a great deal of applications. Go ahead and use either white/yellow glue for this. Some people would even use cyanoacrylate or CA glues, like Super/Crazy glue (as well as some other glues), for their balsa models. What is more important is how you apply the glue. You said that you had a clean break which is great. Whether or not this is the case for you I would recommend not removing splinters from the break. You want to glue joint to be as free of gaps as possible. Remove splinters from the break can introduce weak points where the glue might not get the best adhesion. Make sure when you put the staircase back together that you apply glue on both sides of the break enough to cover the entire surface area. If possible you want to clamp the work, or apply pressure in some way as clamps might be excessive for balsa, to force some of the excess glue out from the joint (you dont need a lot in the joint). Clean the extra that does come out. Let it sit for as long as the glue states on the product label.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.8 \t\t Balsa wood is available from many sources and can often be found at local outlets. Various thickness panels are usually presented in shelf units or organizer caddies, typically in 24 or 36 lengths (0.6/0.9m) and varying widths. Balsa wood is quite soft and easily cut, more easily than foam core as it is consistent throughout the thickness. There will be weakness parallel to the grain, however, which means gear teeth will break off if too much force is applied. One could create the model components and then apply a thin layer of PVA glue along with a paper reinforcement layer to mitigate the grain-parallel weakness. 1/8 balsa (3mm) can be cut with a sharp razor knife, but I believe youll have better strength with 3/16 to 1/4 material (4.75 to 6.35mm), especially if you apply paper reinforcement. If one layer on one side appears insufficient, apply a second layer on the other side. It would then be the equivalent of foam core board with a much stronger inner ply. Balsa sands to a very smooth surface. You could then apply a thin layer of glue if you require a harder contact area for reduced friction.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between street art and outdoor murals?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 20.2 \t\t A mural is visual art that is applied directly to a wall. (While most art ends up hanging on a wall, a mural is integral to the wall and cant be, say, moved to a different wall.) Typically it involves paint, but can also be mixed media (e.g., a mosaic). It can be inside or outside. Street art refers to a work of art that is in a public place, often executed without official permission. It may or may not have a political message associated with it (the work in your Question, for example, conveys a message). A painting on a wall can be both mural and street art! But a mural might not be street art (if the artist is paid by the city), and street art might not be a mural (it could be on a sidewalk, it could be a sculpture, etc.). The unsanctioned nature of street art means there is some overlap with graffiti, which is drawing or painting or engraving that is done without permission. A bored teenager who tags my mailbox is performing vandalism, not art. Depending on aesthetic or political preference, some street art may be designated graffiti by some viewers.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 19.6 \t\t Generally a mural is any art which is applied directly to a wall, often a painting or drawing although the term can also be applied to sculptural reliefs. Street art is a bit more general and is usually used for art which takes place in public spaces. As well as semi-permanent media like murals this can also apply to performances or temporary media like pavement drawing. The term can also be applied to things like portrait drawing which take place on the street although in this sort of context the term street artist might be more appropriate than street art. Historically graffiti generally implies casual drawing of painting on public or private structures often without permission. However it is also associated with a set of painting styles using aerosol cans, often on quite a large scale. As with all definitions of art what is and is not intended as art is debatable and mutable. In many western cultures street art has associations with urban subcultures and political protest although again, it is becoming increasingly mainstream and there are a few examples, notably Banksy where it it pretty much part of teh mainstream elite art market...although again what this actually means is a whole other debate in itself. The actual style and medium can vary a lot. From the context of the question it seems like you are thinking mostly about images painted on walls etc but most cultural forms, dance, poetry, music, theatre ect have some street version which may be either more of less underground or be part of more mainstream cultural as seasonal or festival events. Consider also Yarn Bombing and Guerrilla Gardening There is also some overlap with public art (typically large scale sculpture) although street art implies something less formal and less permanent. Similarly street tends to imply a more urban setting.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 14.2 \t\t This is a pretty broad question; Ill try to answer, but this is going to be long. You have already noted many differences between indoor and outdoor climbing. What could you add to this list of safety concerns? Here are some more ideas on safety: You mentioned pure length of routes; the issue here seems to be about having a too short rope, so if you dont have a knot on the other end, the climber will fall when he is being lowered (i.e. when both the climber and the belayer least expect that). In indoor climbing, someone more experienced is usually responsible for rope length, so this is less likely to happen. Falling rocks are often a major safety concern (you should wear a helmet, even though it doesnt guarantee safety). You mentioned insecure bolts, but there may be other hazardous pieces of gear; in the indoor gym they are certainly going to check and replace gear regularly. In the case of an accident, help may be far away. Besides from safety, what are major differences between sport (indoor) climbing and rock (outdoor) climbing? Differences besides safety (just a few of ideas; there certainly is an enormous number of differences, like between working out in a gym vs. running natural trails): Most important difference: natural rock is natural; its just the real thing vs. pieces of plastic. Depending on your spiritual inclination, you may absolutely hate climbing gym after you try real rock climbing. Natural rocks have different types (limestone/sandstone/granite/other), while gyms have plastic, maybe wood and the occasional imitation of limestone (plaster?). Holds on natural walls have an infinite number of shapes, so what you see is not what you get (the hold may be better or worse than you expect). It may also be tricky to find the usable holds, when they are not painted in colours. Its common to have long holdable cracks in nature, which are hard to find in gyms. There is also slab climbing (60° walls with almost invisible holds), which you cannot find in gyms. Depending on how many natural rocks you have, on-sight climbing may be either very hard or very easy to find. For example, when I go climbing to my usual crag(s), if I want to climb a route I have never tried, it has to be much harder than I am able to (because I have tried almost all routes there already) - but when I go to a new place, I climb just new routes. This is unlike indoor climbing, where they are constantly building new routes. Route-finding may be tricky in nature - depends on the site. Are the difficulties comparable to indoor scaling systems? Regarding grades: The idea is to have the grades for indoor and outdoor climbing as equal as possible; however, its not really possible... For the reasons you mentioned (variable weather conditions; unusual bolting). Here are some more ideas on what differences you can find: Some rock-climbing sites have a sort of snobby elitist culture: they insist that in their site F6a is hard, and stop complaining, while others say that F7a should be doable, otherwise no one will come here. You may be individually well-suited for a particular type of rock, but ill-suited for another (overhangs/vertical walls). So a route in outdoor climbing may be easier or harder then an indoor route of the same grade.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between carbon and charcoal pencils?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.6 \t\t The carbon the pencil producers refer to is to be understood as an abbreviation for amorphous carbon one of the three most common allotropes of Carbon (i.e. stablilized multiatomic structures of atomic carbon) The other well know allotropes are Graphite and Diamond. If you had a diamond pencil you would also have a pencil made of carbon - however a much harder carbon allotrope. Hence it will not produce any line (at least not on paper). See also the wikipedia artikle. Carbon pencils will contain amorphous carbon along with other ingredients to produce a deeper black without the scratchyness of pure charcoal.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.4 \t\t These charcoal pencils are just a demonstration of the styles of pencil you might encounter. Wooden Coated Charcoal The first pencil, labeled soft is a softer charcoal pencil, coated in wood. Wooden charcoal pencils are generally cheaper and require a sharp blade (ex exacto knife) to sharpen them. They would not easily sharpen in a traditional pencil sharpener as the charcoal is so soft that a regular sharpener would grind and break the charcoal during the sharpening process. Paper Coated Charcoal The second pencil is coated in paper. Paper coated pencils are generally more expensive, but provide the ease of being able to reveal more of the charcoal by simply pulling the string and unraveling the paper rather than sharpening the pencil with a blade. The 600-H identification on the pencil is just Prangs model number for that pencil and means nothing with respect to the charcoal grade. White Charcoal The 558 is Generals line of white charcoal pencil and, like the 600-H is proprietary to the company and has no real meaning with respect to the charcoal. White charcoal is obviously different from black charcoal but is used in much the same way, but in reverse. White charcoal is a great way to come back after the work is finished to really bring out highlights and shines to be a whiter than white which brings contrast and boldness to an image. White charcoal really isnt charcoal at all, but a type of pastel or Conté, often chalky and meant to be used with charcoal. It can be made from mixing white pigment with some type of binder, but the exact makings are generally proprietary and not disclosed.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.6 \t\t The characteristics between soft charcoal pencil and light charcoal pencil are different. Soft charcoal pencil is darker than medium and hard charcoal pencil, it is a black color. Its easy to crush, and the first time I used it, it became very short in one day. Light charcoal have two meanings: Light can mean hard, as light, medium, dark corresponds with hard, medium, soft: Light = Hard charcoal pencil. Dark = Soft charcoal pencil. Light can refer to the white charcoal pencil in some brands, used to draw lighter areas. Ignore the second meaning when the brand states Light, Medium, Dark - it means the same as HB to 4B, giving good results from light to dark. When the brand states Soft, Medium, Hard (as for example Han Zi, a Chinese brand, does), there is hardly a difference between the light to dark results. But soft charcoal pencils give nice results in drawing, too. Using my soft charcoal pencil results in the center of it being darker than the edges, giving a Photoshop-like blur brush effect.\n",
            "#> are cloaks warmer than coats?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.5 \t\t Actually on Larps I found out that cloaks are much more warmer solution than jackets, have to guess but I think because they trap the air around your body. A thin layer of fabric cloak has more warming effect than the same or even a bit thicker layer of jacket/robe. At least in my experiences. Also for movement I found that in cloaks I don’t feel like a dummy doll my movements are much more free if I count with the cloak of course. This is a reason why many of my friends and me try to always opt for cloaks in case of Larp. I’m surprised that others experienced the exact opposite. Naturally you want to find in any case the most optimal pattern. Because cloaks can be very simple how you wear them can also be varied very easily. Also they have a much more variety of uses like: a mat, a pillow, a blanket etc... These are advantages in Larp or camping or were in the medieval times. And just a bonus: look much more cooler. In modern day use we have similar things mostly for women called poncho which I actually use in my daily life.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.0 \t\t I used to larp and always opted for coats/jackets rather than cloaks whenever feasible. Here are the considerations I used to make frequently about outerwear, listed from highest to lowest priority for myself: It is easier to add useable pockets (whether hidden or visible) Fitted garments with sleeves are less likely to get caught in doors or get accidentally stepped on (eg. when ascending/descending stairs) Fitted garments are likely to be warmer than a loose cloak in most cases Fastening a jacket/coat etc is easier and more secure than most cloak fastenings Cloaks are unusual in most modern cultures and will draw more attention than a sleeved garment, which may not always be wanted I would like to add that a lot of these pros/cons rely on subjective opinion and context. I have some limited experience with sewing garments that have hoods, and have found it to be quite challenging to get the exact shape of hood that I want! I have found it comparatively easy to produce sleeves, so this is why I have not discussed whether sewing a cloak or sleeved garment would be easier, because in my opinion if you are making a garment with a hood, either option will be about the same difficulty.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.1 \t\t Yes, you can always add layers to stay warmer. Exactly how much warmer isnt really possible to figure out, as different jackets put their insulation in different places (e.g., more in the torso/arms/hood). Using multiple layers has the benefit that you can take off only some of your insulation if you are getting too warm (for example, if you start hiking up hill) and add some insulation back when you get cool (stop moving). The downside is that two layers are heavier than one for a similar amount of insulation.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 23.0 \t\t I know several people who recommend the Harvey maps, so theyre obviously not terrible. The main advantage is the 1:40,000 scale which offers most of the detail of a 1:25,000 map while covering a larger area. Additionally, they dont have many irrelevant features like county boundaries and slightly more colourful style than OS maps, which make it easier to understand the map at a glance. The larger area of the maps allows them to cover more useful areas where multiple 1:25000 maps would be needed. Particularly the Lakes, which are covered by 4 OS maps compared to 1 Harvey map. Additionally, their waterproofness is pretty good and can make them much easier to use than using a mapcase or a laminated OS map, which are much more bulky. Obviously as OS maps cover the entire country Harvey maps are never strictly necessary, but in many situations they can provide an, at least arguably, better alternative to OS maps.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 20.7 \t\t Well, if youve ever tried walking in countries like Spain or Italy, we should celebrate the fact that we are spoiled for choice.

First, you should understand that they offer two main series - the SuperWalker maps at 1:25k and mainly centered on popular mountains, and the newer BMC Mountain Maps that cover wider areas at 1:40k. Heres what I like about the Harvey offerings: They are tougher than the OS maps, without the bulk of the lamination. You dont need a map case - just fold and roll and stick them in a pocket. The footpaths are often more complete and accurate - they get on the ground and check them out. Its the same for rocky and marshy ground - they get out there and check the terrain. Subjectively, I find the contouring and shading is clearer - compare the mapping of the Cuillin, for example. They omit details like administrative boundaries that clutter the mapping and are of little interest to walkers. They name the popular climbing crags. They offer maps scaled and centered to show a whole area - eg 1 map for the Lakes, vs 4 for the OS. The Dartmoor map, for example, is more convenient than the two-sided OS Explorer. They offer strip-maps covering many of the National Trails, while you would need multiple OS maps for the same coverage. They offer useful specialist maps - eg large scale summit maps for complex tops and fell running maps for popular races and challenges. The contours are visible using a night-vision red light, while they are pretty much unreadable on the OS map. On the downside: For the 40k sheets you wont have a romer on your compass, but they do sell one for £1. When youre trying to navigate the valleys though farms and fields the 1:40k can lack detail vs 1:25k mapping. Theyre not so clear about the access status of the land. They dont show as many ancient monuments. They dont show pubs! (Dont they understand their market??) Long story short - both the OS and Harvey make great maps. There will be times when one suits your usage better than another, and times when you might use them in combination - eg the more detailed 1:25k OS map for planning and the more convenient 1:40k Harvey on the hill.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 19.8 \t\t Ive used OS 1:25k and 1:50k extensively in the UK. I also have a little experience of using 1:40k Harveys maps (Lake district, for mountain marathons). I have been impressed with the Harveys: in detail as well as scale they sit nicely in between the two OS scales. So you get very detailed contours (nearly as much as the OS 1:25k), but less of the clutter on the 1:25k OS maps - they dont attempt to map every fence post and small rock. I personally find that a lot of the fine detail in the 1:25k is not very helpful for navigation, but I do like to have more detailed contours than the 1:50k offers. Another (small) advantage with the Harveys is that they seem to have more sensible coverage. For example, in the Lake District I recently had to take four OS maps where one of the Harveys maps would have covered it. But that just depends on where you want to walk.\n",
            "#> how much water does a person need per day to survive?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.6 \t\t According to NAP.edu, the minimal (obligatory) daily water loss for an adult is at least 1 liter (~1 quart), which includes losses by the urine, feces, insensible perspiration and breathing (but not sweating). So, if you are sweating minimally, you would need to drink about 1 liter of water per day to keep yourself well hydrated. You can know you are well hydrated, when you do not have any symptoms of dehydration (dry mouth, thirst, strong yellow urine, poor skin turgor). About rationing water (only some theory at this point) Lets say you are a 70 kg with 60%, that is 42 kg (liters), of water in your body. Death can occur when you lose 20% (~8 liters) of the body water. If you lose 1 liter of water per day and drink 1 liter each day, 2 gallons (7.5 liters) of water would keep you well hydrated for 7.5 days. After that you will continue to lose 1 liter of water per day, youll become progressively dehydrated, but you could survive for the additional 8 days, so 15.5 days in total. If you drink 0.5 liters per day from the beginning, it seems you will develop a negative balance of 8 liters of water in 16 days, so basically the same as in the above scenario. But, when you become dehydrated, you lose progressively smaller amounts of water, and this could make you survive a bit longer when you start to ration water from the beginning. However, as a result of rationing water, the toxic waste products (urea) will start to build in your blood. Its then the question about the balance of harms of the buildup of urea in your blood and benefits of the sparing of water by your kidneys. The question How much water should I ration myself each day? can be answered only by showing several convincing reports of how someone did it successfully (news reports...). Im not sure if I know one. And, they dont usually do any human trials on this topic... Practically, you would probably lose more than 1 liter of water per day because sweating occurs even if you sit in a shade, especially in summer.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.6 \t\t How much water you need depends on how big you are, how fit you are, where you are and what youre doing.

You lose water through your breath, perspiration, urine and bowel movements. If youre a big guy thats out of shape, breathing heavy and sweating lots while hiking through the Western Cwm, then youre going to need a lot more water than the skinny little Sherpa thats leading the way. There may be situations where 100ml per hour is plenty, I can definitely survive on less than that depending on what Im doing, I managed to go 48hrs straight without any food and water at all while trekking out in the summer heat once, but my body definitely wasnt functioning normally. Its important to understand your own body and how much water YOU need for certain activities. This comes with experience, your friend may be able to operate on only 100ml/hour, but that doesnt mean everyone else can. Learn to recognize the beginning stages of dehydration (fatigue, headache, yellow urine) and drink enough to stay hydrated. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to budget water, then do it the same way you would budget fuel on a long drive: go slow, dont over work the engine, keep it cool, and take the easy route. Techniques for reducing water loss while hiking: Dress - In hot hot environments, you will actually retain water better by wearing long sleeve shirts and pants made out of light breathable materials. Also cover your head and neck. There are reasons why you dont see anyone in the Sahara riding camels wearing shorts and t-shirts, and the sun is only one of them. Hiking in shorts and t-shirts will keep you cooler, but so will hiking with a spritz bottle of ice water and a portable fan... Hiking in sweat-dampened clothing may not feel like it keeps you quite as cool, but keeping the sun off your skin will heat your body less, and you wont lose water into the air through evaporation quite as fast. Breathing - Close your mouth. Breathe through your nose. Youre sinuses preform a function beyond producing excess amounts of mucous when you get a sniffle. At the very least exhale through your nose. Leaving your mouth wide open while you hike will dehydrate you just as fast a sweating. Move at a pace that your respiratory system can keep up with. Toileting - Hold it (if you can). Sometimes when people get moving, other things get moving too. You need to give your large intestine enough time for it to reclaim as much water as it can from your stool.

            "#> what is the difference between alpaca wool and sheep wool?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 26.5 \t\t The main difference between alpaca and merino (or any other) wool is the fur itself. Alpaca is not technically wool, as it has a different construction. Its fiber, which is more like hair. Because Alpaca fiber is hollow, it has many advantages over merino wool. Its warmer, softer, more lightweight, thermal for use in all seasons. Its also durable. As for warmth: Studies done at the Yocum-McCall Testing Laboratories have this to say: In the Yocum-McCall Testing Laboratories, alpaca was shown to be three times warmer than sheep’s wool. Why? One reason is that alpaca is more heavily medullated: in other words, there are tiny hollow areas in the centers of many individual alpaca fibers. These areas hold the warmth and, in addition, make alpaca lighter in weight than other animal fibers. Another study showed that if worn in a 0 degree F environment, alpaca would give a 50 degree F comfort range. Sheep’s wool would provide a 30 degree F comfort range in the same environment. From here: Alpaca fiber is warmer than wool if the gauge of yarn is the same. From here: Alpaca is warmer than sheep’s wool. Alpaca is softer than almost all sheeps wool. Merino can be close, but in order to be soft, it has to be processed in a certain way. The Alpaca fiber youd find on the market is naturally soft, so you dont have to think about that. If you want to compare the two equally, you have to make sure your merino wool has been through the softening process. That process includes a lot of chemicals, whereas alpaca fiber needs no processing at all. Some people who want to make sure theyre wearing a natural product choose alpaca fiber. Another major difference is that Alpaca is classified as water-resistant, and is close to being water-proof. Its considered a “dry fiber. Compared to merino, this is beneficial in a number of ways, especially for outdoor use. Its thermal and excellent at wicking water away from the skin. This makes it more comfortable, and increases its capacity to be warmer. If you pour water on alpaca, it will get wet. However, it does offer great wicking abilities. Wool will absorb up to 50% of its body weight in moisture, but after this there is a saturation point and the sweat can sit next to skin, increasing discomfort, odor and likelihood of blisters (socks rubbing against the skin). Because alpaca is hollow, it traps in more heat and mechanically pushes the water away, never having a saturation point on the skin. Essentially, the water evaporates because of the warmth of the alpaca. Source Other sources also list that as an important consideration, and add that in general, alpaca doesnt become moldy or grow mildew. This is helpful when youre traveling. You dont need to spend a lot of time stopping to let it dry, and you dont need to worry about it spreading mold to your other clothes. It also doesnt smell bad. Alpaca does not absorb water into the hair, rather it sheets it off. This factor allows for alpaca to make wonderful outwear and it is why when caught in the rain an alpaca cloth will not smell. Also, because of its water resistance, alpaca is not subject to mold and mildew under normal conditions. Source Alpaca is also less likely to cause itching. Sheeps wool fur has tiny scales along the edges, whereas alpaca fiber is more smooth. The outside of each strand of sheeps wool has tiny, microscopic scales along the length of the strand. When garments made with wool are worn next to the skin, these scales catch the surface of the skin and cause some wool to feel prickly. Strands of alpaca fiber are smooth and therefore feel less prickly or itchy next to the skin. Source People with hypersensitive skin, like me, may notice an itch even with alpaca fiber. In that case, its recommended to wear it as an outer layer, or between other layers of clothing. Some chemically treated merino wool is also soft and comfortable. Here are a few things I found about durability: Durable: A huge Alpaca clothing benefit is that Alpaca fiber is water, wind, and stain resistant. It will shield you from the wind and the rain on a cold day. This allows it to last longer than just about any other material used to make clothes. Source. This site has a fun comparison of different types of wool, including many we wouldnt think of. This is what they say about durability: Alpaca is soft as cashmere but stronger and less costly. It’s more durable than merino. In terms of durability, bison is in most cases the strongest, followed by qiviut and yak down, followed by alpaca and then merino. From here: Alpaca is warmer, stronger, lighter, hypoallergenic, and more resilient than wool. Also: Alpaca is a versatile, warm, strong, water resistant fiber which is produced on a gentle, hardy animal. Source Clothing: Alpaca is more expensive than wool, but if youre going to choose a wool, merino seems to be the best of the bunch. If you can afford cashmere, mohair, or Alpaca wool long johns, go for it. Otherwise, Merino wool is the best of the sheep wools. Next to our skin, it is soft, stretchy, supple, and comfy. Source Pretty much all of the major sites sell alpaca socks (often a blend with merino), hats, scarves, mittens, and things of that nature, and some sell sweaters. One of the many I liked (no affiliation) is Alpacas of Montana. Alpaca is considered a dry fiber, without lanolin that is found in sheep’s wool. When the chill of winter hits the air, turn down your thermostat, get into some alpaca socks or alpaca hat, and enjoy. Alpaca socks continuously & naturally wick moisture, breathe, eliminate odor and help moderate your skin temperature in any environment, thick and thin styles. After much searching I was able to find one (again no affiliation) that sells layers, including lightweight shirts, and outerwear, including field pants and field coats. Theyre not cheap, but definitely worth taking a look if alpaca interests you. Its worth noting that alpaca fiber doesnt wrinkle, or only a small amount, making it easy to carry in a backpack or anything else in which you store your clothes. Also, alpacas naturally grow in 22 different colors, which makes the choice of clothing more fun!\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.6 \t\t Alpaca wool is both lighter and warmer than sheep wool due to it being hollow. It also may be softer, depending on the specific herd of animals. This is a nice rundown of different types of wool. Softer and sturdier than cashmere and lighter than sheeps wool, alpaca fleece is a luxurious commodity that produces warm, silky, durable and feather-light garments... A fine, silky and lightweight fiber Nice luster Creates strong, durable and pill-resistant fabrics I would say in general, alpaca is made more into sweaters, or heavier weight clothing, while merino is commonly used for both warm and cold weather as a base/mid layer. For socks specifically, look into the material percentages. Socks are almost always blended, which greatly affects the performance.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.9 \t\t Alpaca socks are unique in that alpaca is a hollow core fiber. This means the yarns that make up the socks wrap your foot like a radiator carrying warm air to keep your feet warm when its cold outside. In addition, alpaca fiber is 5 times stronger than wool and the scale height of each fiber is about 30% as high as wool. Scales are small barbs on the fiber that can be scratchy when worn on sensitive skin. This is why many people who say they are allergic to wool have no issues when wearing alpaca. The other great feature about the smaller scale height is that the fiber is very smooth resulting in less blisters and rubbing on your feet during hikes or long walks. Another great feature about alpaca socks is how well they wick moisture. This occurs when we blend the hollow core fiber of alpaca with synthetic fibers to add stretch and durability. This combination along with our specific knitting styles wicks the moisture away from your feet and up the length of the sock where it quickly dissipates.\n",
            "#> do robins appear all year round?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.5 \t\t Robins are an all year round bird in the UK: RSPB with its bright red breast it is familar throughout the year and especially at Christmas! Males and females look identical, and young birds have no red breast and are spotted with golden brown. So this proves, for those of a keen eye, that theres inherently nothing special about the Robin Male vs Female, only the juveniles have a different colouring, no changes throughout the seasons like some mammals, nothing. Theyre pretty dapper in their red chests all year. SoWhyDoI Although robin folklore existed for many years, the robin became far more widely associated with Christmas after it was depicted on Christmas cards in 19th century England; a tradition that has been retained to this day. Why are robins on Christmas cards? It’s all inspired by the robins who used to deliver the Christmas cards in 19th century Britain. In the 1800s, British postmen wore bright red uniforms. They wore red in honor of the crown since red is considered both a Royal color and an important color on the English flag. (Incidentally, this may also be one of the reasons why British post boxes were eventually standardized to be red). The postmen in their red-breasted coats resembled the much-loved British bird, the robin red-breast, earning Victorian postmen the nick-name: Robins. Ok so this is a nice piece of information I did not know - Posties have always had a nickname of sorts, and it could be a valid reason for why they are on Christmas cards etc around that time of year, however there are other speculations too. Christianity: Legend has it that the robins redbreast gives it a direct link to Christianity. One fable suggests that when the baby Jesus was in his manger in the stable, the fire which had been lit to keep him warm started to blaze up very strongly. A brown robin, noticing that Mary had been distracted by the inn-keeper’s wife, placed himself between the fire and the face of baby Jesus. The robin fluffed out its feathers to protect the baby, but in so-doing its breast was scorched by the fire. This redness was then passed onto future generations of robins. Further reading: Saga website on Christianity and Robins I think as well one good idea about why they are on postcards is when we used to get a huge blanket of snow Mr Robin Redbreast would stand out against the bland colours of winter with his bright red feathers, the contrast looked good and someone painted it and... here we are!\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.2 \t\t One unusual thing about robins is that theyre territorial all year round. Combined with the way they sing from prominent spots to mark out their territory, this makes them really rather obvious in the winter, when other birds are quiet and inconspicuous. Robins, as well as being plentiful, are also quite confiding around humans, mainly in the UK where we lack large wild herbivores to turn over soil and expose insects1. While mainly insectivorous theyll happily take seed and other food from human sources, meaning that when food supplies are low they come to gardens. Once there, as theyre so confiding, they often feed closer to people than other birds, coming for food almost immediately. Its not unknown for people to hand-feed wild robins in the garden. Overall if you hear a bird singing around Christmas its probably a Robin, and the song will draw attention to a bird which is after all quite striking for something so common. Their habit of perching on artificial structures for some time (and returning to the same song posts) also makes them easy to observe, and paint/draw/photograph. 1 Wikipedia cites RSPB Birds of Britain and Europe, Rob Hume 2002 (ISBN 0751312347), which is where Id read about this peculiarly localised aspect of behaviour.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.5 \t\t I live in the UK and the first time I noticed Robins nesting was in the top of a down pipe. Unfortunately the heavens opened and we had flash floods. The water filled up and the 6 babies died despite taking them to a rescue centre. I put up 2 Robin nest boxes directly underneath and around. Within 3 days they nested again. Each year Im really lucky to have the Robins come back. They nest at least 3 times a year. They have just had one brood fledge and I was lucky enough to watch all 4 leave successfully. (As a rule they dont hang around long though, however last year adult and babies fed from.my hand on the ground.)The nest box was emptied 2 days after flight day and 2 and a half weeks later, they have another nest built. Im so lucky to have them. They are right by my kitchen window, just above head height and with their proximity to us, become very familiar. Im intrigued to understand how or why it happens every year, as the life span isnt long and theyve been coming now for 4 years.\n",

If youre still uncertain, you can simply try using your stove with kerosene, if its the international stove itll work just fine, but youll probably notice that it doesnt start as easily, thats because kerosene needs more heat to reach its flash point. I think thats the biggest difference between the two, is just getting it started, the wick and sleeve on the international stove aid in heating the kerosene to a vapour. You cant damage it by putting kerosene in it, even if it isnt the international, itll just sputter and flame and get black from not burning right, but as soon as you put white gas back in it itll clean it right out.\n",

Benzene is destroyed during combustion, but the vapors from unburned fuel are a hazard. Make sure you close the fuel bottle tightly when its not in use, handle the fuel outdoors or in a well-ventilated area, and make sure your stove is burning cleanly (it should produce a blue flame indicating complete combustion; a yellow flame indicates that the fuel isnt being fully burned). This is a great example of why that warning is a problem: the occasional real hazard (such as benzene in fuel) gets lost in a sea of empty statements.\n",
            "#> are nylon pants good for hot weather?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.2 \t\t You will need more than one pair of pants. Nylon hiking shorts. Dry fast. Cool in hot weather. Im uncertain how culturally appropriate shorts are on adult males in SA. In touristy areas they are used to crazy gringos. Nylon wind pants. These cover you -- something you will want when there are bugs. I prefer ones with zips at the cuffs so I can either have them cinched down for wading leech infested water, or unzip a few inches to get better ventilation. BDU pants. These are commonly sold as military/paramedic/Police work pants. You can get them in cotton, and various blends. Often with reinforced knees and seat. Usually with a smoother finish than denim, and much better stain resistance. When new and clean the non-cargo pants can serve as casual slacks. If you are going to be high enough to be cold, a lightweight pair of synthetic sweat pants. These can be used both for sleeping wear to extend your bags limit, or as long johns under your wind pants. Darkish colours, but short of black seem to be best about not showing dirt. Very light colours are coolest. For extended canoe trips in Canada I bring a pair of nylon running shorts, nylon wind pants, and polypro long johns. For tops I have a drywick tee, a middle weight fleece and a waterproof breathable jacket. I also bring a toque.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.0 \t\t Nylon dries fast, is resistant to ripping and tearing, and fairly breathable. This makes a nylon pant great for 3-season conditions. In colder season weather it can be easily layered with baselayer leggings to provide additional warmth and wick some sweat. Alternatives to the typical nylon hiking pant/short are running shorts and softshell pants. Running shorts are even more breathable and dry even faster simply because theres less to them. Softshell pants are more expensive and will dry slower but provide additional protection against light precipitation and wind.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.7 \t\t Nylon, among other synthetics, is an ideal material for clothing for most outdoor pursuits for several reasons. I will use the example of cotton as the traditional fabric for comparison: Durability: Nylon itself can come in several varieties, some of which are more durable than others due to different weights and weaves. The fabric can handle abrasion, extended washings, and general wear much better than cotton for example, which tends to wear out sooner. Nylon doesnt noticeably shrink either. It is a very durable material. Insulation: Again weight and weave type influence these factors, but generally all nylon varieties are better at insulating than cotton. Even wet nylon will provide insulating value, whereas cotton will actually cause heat loss rather quickly when wet. Moisture Management & Thermo-Regulation: Nylon also dries dramatically faster than cotton. Since it manages moisture well, it keeps you warmer in colder weather because it keeps you drier. And it keeps you cooler in hot weather because it aids in the evaporating of sweat much more quickly. Once again, weight and weave influence these factors, but all nylon types manage moisture better than cotton. Weight & Packability: Nylon generally is a lightweight material in most of its modern outdoor applications, and is enabling some super and ultra light gear to be produced. This includes not just clothing but backpacks and other items. Clothing items made of nylon also tend to have good packability in that they compress to small sizes which is great for backpacking, hiking, etc. Environmental Benefits: Nylon can be produced from some plastic recyclable sources and itself can be recycled to produce new goods when it wears out. This is not an exhaustive list of the attributes of nylon, but provides the main reason it is a go to fabric for outdoor gear. Polyester has similar characteristics to nylon and is another mainstream synthetic fabric. Merino Wool is a natural, renewable material that offers many of these same benefits that nylon does, with the exception of the superior durability provided by nylon.\n",
            "#> are elk and deer color blind?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 27.6 \t\t Humans have trichromatic vision. Deer, Elk (wapiti) and some other animals have dichromatic vision. Its not that deer and Elk cant see oranges and reds, they just perceive them differently. Here is an explanation from Polk County Iowa Deer Color Blindness Are deer are color-blind? Is this why hunters can wear bright orange clothing and the deer don’t seem to notice? Yes, deer have a form of color blindness. All mammals have a retina located in the back of the eye that consists of two types of light sensitive cells called rods and cones. Rods function in the absence, or near absence, of light and permit vision in darkness. Cones function in full light and permit daytime and color vision. Deer have more rods (nighttime cells) and fewer cones (daytime and color cells) than humans. Therefore, deer have better nighttime vision than humans but poorer daytime and color vision. Deer lack red cones so they cant distinguish between green, yellow, orange, red or brown. All of these colors appear as shades of yellow. So the blaze orange color hunters wear appears yellow, as does almost everything else to a deer. Elk have similar vision as deer. According to this site, When it comes to sight, elk aren’t endowed with precise vision. In fact, they see around the human equivalence of 20-60. Additionally, they don’t see the full color spectrum humans do. Elk vision is dichromatic, which means their world is seen in two colors, not trichromatic like our vision. There is a whole science to ungulate vision, but to keep it simple, just know this. Elk don’t have a red cone like humans, so the upper end of the color spectrum appears yellowish to elk. They aren’t color blind, but they don’t see color the way we do. As a bonus, its speculated that deer may have the ability to perceived ultraviolet light better than humans. In August 1992, a group of leading deer researchers and vision scientists gathered at the University of Georgia to conduct this landmark study.... Our study confirmed that deer possess two (rather than three as in humans) types of cone photopigments allowing limited color vision. The cone photopigment deer lack is the “red cone, or the one sensitive to long wavelength colors such as red and orange. These colors aren’t invisible to deer, but rather are perceived differently. Deer are essentially red-green colorblind like some humans. Their color vision is limited to the short (blue) and middle (green) wavelength colors. As a result, deer likely can distinguish blue from red, but not green from red, or orange from red. Therefore, it appears that hunters would be equally suited wearing green, red, or orange clothing but disadvantaged wearing blue. The results regarding the UV capabilities of deer were equally fascinating. Our results confirmed that, unlike humans, deer lack a UV filter in their eye. In humans, this filter blocks about 99 percent of damaging UV light from entering the eye. It also functions much like a pair of yellow shooting glasses and allows us to focus more sharply on fine detail. The trade-off is a loss of sensitivity to short wavelength colors, especially in the UV spectrum. Because deer do not have a UV filter, they see much better in the UV spectrum but lack the ability to see fine detail. This helps explain why deer often move their head from side to side when they encounter a hunter. Article Source\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.0 \t\t yes wear it in some states the hunters are required to wear a orange vest too. deer and most animals are color blind so they cant see it but like you say you need to be seen by the hunters\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.0 \t\t I cant take any credit for already knowing this, all my information comes from an article from Penn State University, entitled Deer-Forest Study: The eyes have it! Some of the information in this article appears to contradict the claim at first glance, for example it begins with Day or night, a deer’s vision is excellent. This is good if you’re a deer but bad if you are a hunter. So how do deer see the world? As you read on however, there are some details that clear things up. Relevant facts are that deer eyes have a higher cone-to-rod ratio than humans, and the rods are sensitive to different wavelengths than humans, in particular more sensitive in the blue-violet end of the spectrum, and even into the UV, and less sensitive in the red end. Quoting the article: Deer are essentially red-green color blind (like some people). Deer can distinguish blue from red, but not green from red. Red, orange, or green all look the same to a deer. Because deer lack a UV filter in their eye, their sensitivity to short wavelength colors is enhanced in the UV spectrum. If you remember your rainbow R-O-Y-G-B-I-V, to a deer it is more like X-B-I-V-UV where X is some color combination only a deer would understand. Thus it is not accurate to say deer cant see orange (which is not what the question claims, but I have heard said) but rather that what is obviously orange to a human, is just dim-dull blob to a deer. As a hunter, you would hope this makes you look similar to the dim-dull fall vegetation around you.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between heat index and feels like temperature?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 26.2 \t\t In simple terms: Heat Index is what it feels like based on temperature + relative humidity. Feels Like is temperature + relative humidity + wind speed. With most any breeze, Feels Like is usually a lower number than heat index due to evaporative cooling of your skin by the wind.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.9 \t\t One-liner: Wiki thinks its the same. Although Wiki is not always perfect about information it posts, the justification there make sense to me. Looked up at Heat Index wikipedia, it says, The heat index (HI) or humiture is an index that combines air temperature and relative humidity, in shaded areas, to posit a human-perceived equivalent temperature, as how hot it would feel if the humidity were some other value in the shade. The result is also known as the felt air temperature, apparent temperature, real feel or feels like Quoting other source such as weather.gov: The heat index, also known as the apparent temperature, is what the temperature feels like to the human body when relative humidity is combined with the air temperature. This has important considerations for the human bodys comfort. Additional information for those who dont know that this term means, quoting from the same source again, When the body gets too hot, it begins to perspire or sweat to cool itself off. If the perspiration is not able to evaporate, the body cannot regulate its temperature. Evaporation is a cooling process. When perspiration is evaporated off the body, it effectively reduces the bodys temperature. When the atmospheric moisture content (i.e. relative humidity) is high, the rate of perspiration from the body decreases. In other words, the human body feels warmer in humid conditions. The opposite is true when the relative humidity decreases because the rate of perspiration increases. The body actually feels cooler in arid conditions. There is direct relationship between the air temperature and relative humidity and the heat index, meaning as the air temperature and relative humidity increase (decrease), the heat index increases (decreases). Thanks Ken Graham for the source: For those who prefer values of temperature in degree Celsius, please refer the table here\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.6 \t\t As someone that lives in a high humidity and high-temperature area, I can tell you for certain that feels like and heat index is very much the same thing. Its an insanely important number because, at 90 degrees Fahrenheit in 40% humidity, you can feel very comfortable, but at 90 degrees in 95% humidity you can wish you were dead. (90 degrees Fahrenheit is about 32 degrees Celsius.) Of course, this also affects how you stay hydrated, and how you try to cool your body. In lower humidity, you can just sweat and drink a lot, but in higher humidity, the sweat doesnt evaporate as well so is less effective. Mostly its attempt to quantify a comfort level. But they do mean the same thing.\n",
            "#> is ants safe to eat?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.8 \t\t The practice of eating insects is called entomophagy. References using that term can include many insects. Ive narrowed it down to ants and termites as best as I could, although some of the general advice and information include ants, termites, and other insects. The short answer is that not all ants and termites are safe to eat, but most of those youre likely to encounter, either in the woods or at home, are probably edible. Thats because there are 2,000 different kinds of edible ants in the U.S., and up to 12,000 across the world. For termites, according to the National Institutes of Health-Pub Med, 45 termite species belonging to four families were recorded, and 43 of those have been used in the human diet or for feeding livestock. To be safe, many sources say that Field Guides are strongly recommended before foraging for anything, which certainly makes sense. There are different guides to choose from, all with varying reviews. Ill leave that to you to investigate. There are a few things to pay close attention to when choosing what to eat. *Warning: Although many insects are edible, entomophagy poses some risks. If you are allergic to shrimp, shellfish, dust, or chocolate, never eat an insect. Even the non-allergic, unless in a survival situation, should never eat a raw insect. Certain insects store compounds that make some people sick; some are poisonous; others may be carcinogenic. Be as cautious with insects as you would be if you were gathering mushrooms. Know your insects! Source. Some advice is a bit vague, saying things like Before hunting for ants, make sure you know which ones in the area are safe to eat and hunt. Source To determine what to avoid, agreement across sources is that insects which are brightly colored, furry, or have a strong smell, should be avoided. The color can be a signal to predators that they contain poisons, which would also be toxic to us. They also tend to be the insects with stingers, including ants. Even if theyre safe to eat, we can get hurt in the process. Secrets of Survival offers a good summation: Experts say that insects with bright colors like red, orange and yellow arent safe to eat. Their coloration is a warning to predators that theyre toxic. Due to the danger of eating poisonous insects, its best to just swear off red, orange, and yellow bugs. On the other hand black, brown, and green are typically colors of insects that are safe to eat. If you detect a strong odor around an insect, thats also a sign that its probably not a safe insect to eat. Many sources say not to eat wild insects that are already dead, especially if youre going to eat them raw. This is mostly because you wont know what killed them. If they were killed by pesticides or diseased animals, they may be carrying something that could make you sick, so its best to steer clear. People who come across busy anthills usually trust that those ants are safe enough to give them a try. Home ant-farming is also a common way to safely incorporate ants into your diet, and is practiced all over the world for that purpose. Theres controversy over eating fire ants. Many sources classify them as edible, but since they fall into the category of insects with stingers, theyre not the first choice, and to leave them alone if you have other options. If you do want to eat them, take some time to remove the stingers first. Also note that they secrete more of what gives ants their sour flavor, so some people find them less palatable. On the other hand, theyre also more spicy, which is one reason people do choose them. Theyre eaten all over the world, so sometimes avoidance is from people who just arent used to them. This is an account from an American family entitled Yes we ate fire ants in a Cambodian Village! They were visiting a native family and immersing themselves in the culture, which included eating many foods not usually eaten by Americans: Eating fire ants was not in our known realm of possibility or desire. There we were, helping prepare lunch, and suddenly the chance to eat fire ants was in front of us. Would I have the courage to do it? The ants were in a pile, immobilized from being in cold water. We were invited to eat them, raw and alive. Uh oh. I can tell you firsthand the hard part is picking them up from the bowl and actually putting them in your mouth. In case you’re interested, they are a little sour at first bite. People all over the world also eat ant larvae. Theyre known to be very safe and delicious. They dont have the sour taste that develops as the ant matures. You can find them in clumps in the ant nest, either at the top or close to the center of the colony, and under rocks by the edge of the nest. Sources recommend searching for them specifically because theyre a delicacy unlike anything else weve tasted. Ants can be eaten cooked or raw. Their natural taste is sour, and like vinegar, so cooking them, especially with other ingredients, makes them taste better. According to Edible insects for humans, ants can be roasted, toasted, stir-fried, baked, used in salads, chocolate-covered or honey-buttered. The most popular recipe found on the internet using ants is called Ant Brood Tacos. If you try those tacos, report back to let us know how they were! As for termites, which are the second most eaten insect on the planet, I couldnt find any ways to determine which are edible just be looking at them. As I said above, thats probably because most of them are. As with ants, they can be eaten cooked or raw. Termites can be cooked in a variety of ways: fried, steamed, roasted or boiled. Of course, if you’re on the go, you can just eat them raw. Source The show Nova on Public Broadcasting Service Network interviewed a family who traveled the earth eating insects. This was taken from a discussion about eating termites in Uganda. Peter: In Uganda, snacking on termites is like raiding the refrigerator in the U.S., except that raiding a termite mound is more work. Faith: First, hack into a waist-high termite mound to expose tunnels; second, cover the tunnel entrances with a cloth; third, wait while soldier termites attack the invading cloth; fourth, yank away cloth, pick off insects, and eat them. Peter: Not bad—crunchy and nutty—but the bites are too little to get a fix on the taste. This snack is not for the squeamish. As with ants, edible termites include those found in and around the house. As long as you havent sprayed with pest treatment or insecticide, theres nothing wrong with eating them. In other countries termites have been valued for their nutrition and medicinal properties. There are larger species than those that I saw and they can build enormous mounds above ground. In my neck of the woods you can find termites in and under logs that lie on the ground. Pine seems to be the favored wood. They prefer warmth and are more likely to be found in sun-lit areas of the forest floor. In my case the termites were collected under mulch debris but some logs can be split open with hatchets or machetes and tapped on the side to cause the termites to fall out onto a tray or collective surface. Next time that you’re walking in the woods, turn over branches and logs that are laying on the ground or explore a tree stump. You may find that these little critters are prevalent and plentiful, and if you dare, pluck one up and give it a taste test! Source More information and recipes can be found all over the internet.

These can be put on and removed in seconds and can be carried in a small bag or even a pocket. But if you get UK-type weather, in which ice is often patchy, avoid grips that use what look like steel springs. These are easily broken on hard surfaces like pavement. Better to get grips with small studs. These used to be expensive but no more; I bought several pairs of perfectly adequate grips in a well-known UK retailer for, yes, £1 a pair.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.8 \t\t Depends on how steep your ice patch is. Crampons are really good when you have steep slopes and you need to do some real front pointing. Crampons are good for mixed climbing as well. They are also heavier than microspikes. Microspikes make a good choice when the slopes are less steep. And when your needs for grip are not that severe. From my experience, they are not as durable as crampons. Some of the spikes just break off if you use them on rocks constantly (thereby reducing the grip as well). Also note that micro spikes cant really dig deep into ice. Its more like a chain you would put on your wheels to give you additional traction. And yes, for lesser glacial patches, microspikes are good and are used by people.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 27.7 \t\t Front country is when you go camping in an established campground that is usually reached by car. While backcountry camping is when you go camping in the backcountry getting to the non established campground by foot or horseback carrying your stuff with you. So this would be an example of a front country campground with a fire ring and picnic table and a car. Source and this would be an example of a backcountry campsite which I backpacked many miles into and there were no human created fixtures of any sort besides the trail. Of course, you can have camps that fall between such as designated backcountry tent campsites in National Parks with provided bear storage.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 26.9 \t\t Front country is a rarely used term; it would only be in contrast to backcountry. Backcountry camping means that you are not near the road or in a developed area. Typically sites can only be reached by foot or boat, often several hours of travel from any development. Facilities will range from absolutely nothing - camp where you like, try not to make a mess - to spartan - a sign on a tree, a ring of stones for a fire, a latrine pit with a wooden box on it. Your behaviour will typically be more restricted (eg no cans or bottles may be brought) than in a developed campground. Front country camping is what I call car camping. There are sites with picnic tables, fireplaces, possibly grills, taps, central bathrooms with sinks, perhaps even flush toilets or showers, electricity, there might be a store or an office with a phone, and its on a road so you can go out and get things if you need them. Neither one of them matches festival camping, which is a farmers field full of tents with no real camping support (fireplaces, picnic tables) but plenty of event support (food stalls, entertainment.) You can ask questions about the details of any kind of camping here on The Great Outdoors, btw.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 26.4 \t\t Charlie has given you an excellent summary of the difference between the two, focused on the difference in exertion and time to reach them, and the amenities to be found at each. There is another important difference: front-country camping gives you very little, if anything, of the feeling of wilderness. You are in a campground with many other people, usually within sight of their tents and cars and food, and within sound of their conversations and whatever noise they are making. You have very little privacy, often no privacy. If you have forgotten something essential, you just hop in your car and go to the nearest store, which is usually pretty close. In backcountry camping, it is not unusual for there to be no one at all anywhere near your campsite especially if you are on a little-used trail or have left the trail and are hiking cross-country. If you hike cross-country, you may see nobody at all for days once you have left the trail. There is nobody to help you if you need help, and nowhere to get whatever you forgot. You are in wilderness, and know it from the vast silence, broken only by the singing of coyotes, the magnificent vistas empty of human presence (and litter), and the night sky with more stars than you have ever seen before, unobscured by artificial lights. You need experience to do backcountry camping safely, which you acquire gradually. First do some front-country camping to make sure you thoroughly understand your equipment. Then, go one day in along a trail, then, several days along a trail, then some modest cross-country backpacking. You probably should go with a group on your early trips.\n",
            "#> are packs of coyotes dangerous?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.4 \t\t In general they are not considered dangerous because they rarely attack humans. You should not run away from coyotes as they will consider you a prey if you do. Under extreme circumstances they may circle an individual or a group. Making noise generally keeps them at bay or at a distance. In 2009, there was, unfortunately, a fatality in Cape-Breton Nova-Scotia. This was the second recorded fatality in North America. From Nova-Scotia website: Coyotes are wild and generally avoid people. However, they should be treated as potentially dangerous. Do not approach a coyote. also according to Nova-Scotia website: The attack in Cape Breton is the first case of this nature in Nova Scotia. There was a fatal case reported in the United States (California) in 1981 (Timm, Baker, Bennett and Coolahan 2004). Coyotes in Eastern Canada are known to be bigger and are sometimes called coyote wolves (locally) in opposition to their smaller counterparts.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.9 \t\t Stay away from them, dont let your kids play outside after dusk by themselves and make sure they are being kids (i.e.- being loud and obnoxious) and keep all food near and around your home inaccessible (including trash cans- use bear country discipline to reduce food reward associated with people smell). Generally, Coyotes are cowards and will avoid humans (your dog is most likely to be a target). That said... City Coyotes are sill a wild (vs domestic) animal and, like any animal in the wild, they have three goals, and three goals only: Eat Dont get eaten Make more of themselves Anything which doesnt further one of those three goals they do not put energy toward (if you think about it, all animals do that, even humans...we just tend to complicate matters). Likewise, anything which threatens their ability to facilitate or maintain these three things will be protected against. Coyotes, while not the bottom of the food chain, are by no means apex predators and so are on constant watch and protect themselves at all cost. They dont even hunt like other predators- one will either act injured to lure prey to them, or playfull to get prey (such as a domesticated dog) to give chase then the pack pounces to make the kill. Humans, while a source of food for City Coyotes, are also a threat to them, and will generally tend to avoid humans. So do your best to limit how much they associate people with food to keep them from wanting to be around people and you increase safety. Additionally, coyotes are a known carrier of rabies, a disease spread through contact with saliva (not a bite, simply saliva coming into contact with the skin and finding a portal of entry to the body- cut, pimple, scab, etc). It is a neurological disease which, upon entering the body, travels through the nervous system to the brain. Symptoms develop once it reaches the brain and, once the virus reaches the brain, it has a 100% mortality rate. DONT ATTEMPT TO FEED OR PET THEM AND SEE A DOCTOR FOR A RABIES SHOT IF ONE LICKS YOU. Rabies can be transmitted in the saliva of an animal for several weeks postmortem depending on decay rate.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.1 \t\t I would say while it is theoretically possible, in practice it would almost surely prove to be a bad idea. Firstly, depending on your location, it could turn out that your local law prohibits keeping wild animals as pets at all. Secondly, even if it was the case that private possession of such animals was legal, coyote pup is still a wild and unpredictable creature. For this reason, even if you decided to put an enormous amount of effort in tedious attempts to tame a wild coyote, it would probably turn out to be unreliable at best and your general experience would be inferior to experience associated with having for example a dog or a cat. In other words, even despite your best efforts and intentions it just wouldnt be any good as a pet and wouldnt have the desirable qualities we love our dogs and cats for, but instead it would have a wide variety of extremely undesirable and hazardous ones. Please mind the fact that for comparison it is estimated that it took about a few tens of thousand years to domesticate dogs from their wild ancestors and this long process, involving genetic trait selection, just cant in any way scale down to a single specimen. Also, coyotes are carnivorous predators and their hardwired killing instinct would make them extremely dangerous in domesticated settings, because it could and would unpredictably switch on at any time. Ive seen photos documenting injuries that wild coyotes are able to cause to people, cats, dogs, deers, etc. and in case of animals they sometimes were fatal, it wasnt any nice, trust me. What is more, as far as I know it would be much more difficult to find a coyote-specialized veterinarian. And said veterinarian would definitely have to be involved in the taming scenario because of the wide plethora of pathogens and parasites a wild pup like this could have and potentially transmit to other animals and people. I want to thank you really much for your good will and the tedious effort youve put into saving the life of this poor soul, removing the maggots and taking care of it. But after youre done with the immediate-response emergency healthcare for this pup, the best thing both for you and for the coyote would be involving a specialized wildlife rescue organization and letting them take further care of it.\n",

Rock climbing can mean a lot of very different things: climbing on top-rope in a gym; lead-climbing in a gym; outdoor sport climbing; and outdoor trad climbing (which has different roles for the leader and follower). Mountaineering is basically an extension of hiking, and mountaineering includes lots and lots of different types of skills and activities. Some of these you can learn on your own, but others (e.g., self-arrest with an ice ax) youre better off getting professional instruction in. All forms of rock climbing (with the exception of free-soloing, which is probably not something you should try as a beginner) require a climbing partner, so no, you cannot learn rock climbing all by yourself.\n",

He pulls out his map, finds a route around it, and continues up the mountain.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 23.1 \t\t First, use the jar properly empty. When using the peanut butter, push the bits sticking to the side of the jar down into the main amount in the jar. If you do this regularly, you will not get a sticky residue on the sides, but an almost empty jar. You can get out the bits left in the bottom with a spoon rather than a knife, making it a bit easier. What you are left with just needs a rinse or a normal wash. (You can also look for a different kind of peanut butter, one that is not as sticky, as is the most popular kind where I live.)\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 19.8 \t\t A very easy method Ive found is to eat marshmallows. You can use several mini ones or one or two big ones. Chew the marshmallows in your mouth, so that it becomes a sticky glob. Then swallow the glob. It should be sticky enough to grab the fishbone and drag it down your throat. A variation of this is to use bread and peanut butter. Put peanut butter on a piece of bread, let it be moistened by the saliva, then swallow.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 18.7 \t\t If its honeydew, then soap & water should do the trick. Do not use harsh soap. An alternative method is to use a gritty, oily mixture to rub it out. Im thinking maybe baking soda & vegetable oil. The grit helps break up the sticky substance, and the oil keeps it from re-sticking. Similar to using peanut butter to get gum out of your hair. Then use a soap & water solution to wash the oil out. Good luck, and let us know what ended up working.\n",
            "#> what kind of coffee do you use in a coffee maker?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.9 \t\t Yes. For a drip coffee maker, most people will want to use a medium grind that balances getting enough extraction and still allowing the water to flow through the coffee grounds. For immersion (boiled) coffee, you generally want a course grind that will slow extraction somewhat (reduce the chance of over extraction) and make the grounds less likely to end up in the final product.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.4 \t\t Commercial coffee-maker cleaners contain phosphoric acid, citric acid, hydroxyacetic acid or other mild acids that dissolve scale that holds the coffee stain to the metal, so you could also use citric acid (sold as sour salt for cooking) or even vinegar (though its only 5% acetic acid, so may need heat and extra time to remove stains). A commercial stainless-steel cleaner containing oxalic acid, such as Bar Keepers Friend, should also be effective. My personal experience is that the abrasive in this type of cleaner helps the acid to remove scale and stain. You could even make your own oxalic acid by extracting it from rhubarb leaves.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.3 \t\t Ground coffee is just the roasted coffee beans ground up to a fine powder. In order to make the beverage coffee, you need to combine this with hot water to extract the flavour (there are many different ways to do this). Typically, there is a filter that makes sure that the water can pass through the ground coffee but none of the ground ends up in your drink. Instant coffee is dried brewed coffee - they grind up the coffee beans, brew the coffee and then remove the water. A coffee machine or coffee maker is used for brewing coffee from ground coffee, not instant coffee. Instant coffee powder just needs to be rehydrated, so adding hot water is enough. It will completely dissolve in the water, which the ground in a coffee maker will not. The machine you bought seems to be an espresso machine (it puts the water with high pressure through the ground coffee). This requires a relatively fine ground. Preground espresso will probably work, or you can also buy a grinder and grind the beans yourself. It also seems to have a pressurized filter basket, which means it will be quite forgiving and therefore easy to use.\n",
            "#> what kind of coffee do you use for tiramisu?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.2 \t\t From a cooks perspective, I think it should be espresso, or caffè not coffee in any good tiramisu recipe, which in turn would already suggest a type of beans and roast. Note that the Italian term caffè denotes the strong black liquid you get from an esspesso machine or a moka. The coffee in a tiramisu has to be concentrated to supply enough flavour without soaking the ladyfingers or other bisquits used. (The same principle applies when you use a liquor.) When choosing the beans /the roast, the same rule as for wine applies: Use what you drink. And seriously, unless you are making an insane amount of tiramisu, you will be using only very little of one pack of coffee. I use whatever I choose for my Espresso (if I feel rich, Ill splurge on something from my local roaster, in a pinch the usual suspects like Illy or Lavazza, sometimes even a Starbucks Espresso roast cough) and call it a day. So in sort, get a classic Italian espresso roast, prepare it authentically and you should be fine. In a pinch, use another coffee, but make sure it is very strong. Youll need a few tablespoons tops for a standard tiramisu recipe.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.2 \t\t Actually, this is discussed in a different context on Coffee SE a while ago. You may want to check the question and relevant answers What can I do with bad coffee beans? So, even if you have some over-extracted and maybe somewhat stale coffee, you can easily manage to make tiramisu with it. Or maybe coffee liquor. Or mix with whisky or Cognac kind of strong drinks that you can dilute the over-extracted coffee.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.2 \t\t Consider also using a strong preparation of instant coffee or Turkish coffee as an alternative. This will allow cooks in an under-equipped kitchen (said in jest only!) to prepare a coffee of as strong a preparation as youd like, in the absence of moka or espresso machine. It will also help with the temperature issue; usually youll want the prepared coffee to be cooled. You can also use some of the coffee powder as a dusting/garnish in addition to cocoa powder. As for the roast level, I think this is more personal preference. Your options are limited in commercially available instant coffee powder, but the sky is the limit with other preparations. For tiramisu I tend to prefer a very dark roast (French roast, or Italian roast like @Stephie recommended), which I find to be a good complement to rum, but any roast will do. On the other hand, a bit of bright acidity from a lighter-roasted American coffee would probably be a great complement for the creaminess. Ive also seen a coffee liqueur (e.g., Kahlua or Tia Maria) used in part.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between a percolator and an espresso maker?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.8 \t\t These two things are clearly not the same. Here are my reasons: Moka pots - They use small amounts of pressurized water flowing through the coffee grind to make a fine stovetop espresso. The brewing process is relatively cheap and nearly uses the same amount of pressure as a actual espresso machine. You could even call them just mini espresso machines if you wanted to. On the other hand... Percolators - These objects that resemble tall, thinner tea pots make cups of coffee with the high heat and lengthy steeping process. Steeping might not really the word here but here is how they do it: The percolator heats the water from the bottom to create steam. The steam goes up, condenses as water in the top compartment, and then drips through the grounds, making coffee at the bottom of the percolator. The coffee slowly strengthens as the process continues. Flavors may vary... In conclusion, they as in percolators and moka pots are different. Percolators are mainly used to make straight coffee while moka pots make espresso. Their ways of making coffee is different too, and also goes to the flavors. Here is my source. I hope this helps you!\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.2 \t\t A moka pot is what some call a stovetop espresso maker; I find this to be a bit of a misnomer, because the result is rather different than proper espresso. Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water; the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel. The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also this answer). I dont think the grounds are meant to be tamped like espresso, either. A percolator boils water and drips it over grounds continuously. There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot). The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee. I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator. I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), theyre (to me) totally different in outcome. I suspect, but I dont know, if there are regional differences in these terms. Full disclosure: this meta question and my answer prompted this adaptation as a clarification question.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.3 \t\t Im going to focus on the old-school aspect of your question. From my perspective/experience, the classic way of producing camp coffee is a percolator. To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a stovetop espresso maker, though I dont care for that term) -- there are some very compact moka pots like this one that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you wont mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy. See also my related q/a on the difference between a percolator and a moka pot. Those are my preferences for camp coffee. For a little more technology, you can use integrated heater/container systems like the JetBoil; they also have small accessories like this French press insert so you can minimize the extra gear (e.g., you can use the setup for heating water for other cooking, and (separately) use it to make coffee). On the extreme end of low-weight and low-technology spectrum, you could use instant coffee or try coffee bags such as these, which are like tea bags, except that they are filled with coffee. You could even make your own coffee-bags (see instructables and MtBoE). Though there are tradeoffs and reasons you might not want to do this, from Seasoned Advice. These single-serve coffee bags have the advantage of minimal clean-up, and the whole package may be compostable. Also you dont have to worry about hot gear if youre packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me). Storage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly. You can minimize the damage by keeping everything sealed and dry. See also questions about storage in general and vacuum-sealing. You could always use a hand grinder, but thats more gear and more weight. In sum: I go fast and light for coffee on the trail: gear thats reasonably light, that I can use quickly (for me, this is moka pot) so I can get the caffeine-dose done and get back on the trail. Pre-grind the coffee into a zip-top bag and evacuate as much air as possible. Deal with the slightly-stale taste and focus on being outdoors!\n",
            "#> what is the difference between breakfast blend and medium roast?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 21.2 \t\t Breakfast or morning blends are generally a lighter roast, but there is no industry standard for how light of a roast. As for differences between breakfast and morning blends, the key is in the word blend. It is entirely up to the producer to blend different beans and different roasts and call it what they want. Edit: There are some differences in caffeine levels, but a lot of contradictory information out there. I found a great explanation of why the caffeine levels can differ between roasts here, but let me summarize from the post: If you measure your coffee by scoops, light roasted coffee will have more caffeine. Since the beans are denser than a darker roast. However if you weigh out your scoops, darker roasts will have more caffeine, because there is less mass. @ChrisAK is correct, the roasting process does not burn or destroy caffeine, but the level of roast will impact the weight of each bean.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 20.8 \t\t No. Breakfast blends are simply coffees which are blended to present a particular flavor. Typically breakfast blends are lighter, and cleaner which are appetizing as a morning drink as opposed to a heavier, darker blend. Honestly, theres no reason why this is a breakfast blend, other than it has become pseudo-standardized by so many roasteries using the name connected with this style of blend.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 18.5 \t\t For me, there are many factors that all led to my preference to medium-light roasts. Any one of these factors by itself is trivial, but together they form a stronger argument. I wanted to drink coffee black to lessen the empty caloric intake. I didnt like the existing dark-roasted coffee served black. It was too bitter. I think dark-roasts taste great in espresso, but I dont have an espresso machine. Lighter roasts offer more complexities that are interesting served black, but are covered up with milk/sugar. Why preclude those complexities as a roaster? Single origin differences can be drastic, and while master blends might be the best to balance flavors, its nice as a consumer to learn the differences myself and make my own blend. So I dont think theres a stigma against it, its just thats not what people like me are looking for. I hated coffee before I discovered lighter roasts, and I think there are a lot of people like me who have been converted by it.\n",
            "#> what kind of coffee do you put in a coffee maker?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.2 \t\t Absolutely not! The Nescafé is not coffee in the sense of coffee beans, ground, ready for brewing. It’s instant coffee, which means coffee was brewed and then freeze-dried. The resulting granules can then be put in hot water to create a coffee drink (although some fundamentalist would dispute the claim that the result qualifies as “coffee, but I digress). Think of it as the coffee-equivalent of a bullion cube. If you put that in your machine, you would - at best - get a weird result and possibly damage it. What you need for the Moka (the kind of stovetop espresso maker you got) are real coffee beans. Either you get whole beans plus a grinder or you buy pre-ground beans. Some will frown upon the latter, but if you are totally new, it should be ok as a start and I recommend it. Read the labels, because ground coffee comes in different grind sizes, but mainstream Italian coffee brands like Lavazza, Illy, Segafredo and the other usual suspects will for example put a little symbol on the packs showing a Moka like yours, indicating a suitable grind. Apart from that, follow the instructions that (hopefully) came with your coffee maker, e.g. fill the bottom chamber to the fill line (or just under the valve if not line is given), fill the coffee grounds chamber (the funnel-thingy) flush, but don’t compress, remove from the heat when it starts making gargling noises... The Nescafé is the same as the one-serving sachets you mentioned before, so if you are ok with that, you can still use it up when you don’t want to pull out the Moka. Although I suspect once you have come to appreciate a good coffee from fresh beans, you won’t want to go back to instant.\n",

            "\t [3] \t\t 21.5 \t\t Determine what kind of coffee you are working with. Different kinds of coffee have different amounts of caffeine. USDA-accredited values are: Normal - 40 mg Decaffeinated - 1 mg Espresso - 212 mg Decaffeinated espresso - 1 mg Instant - 3,142 mg Instant chicory - 21 mg Instant french - 246 mg Instant mocha - 360 mg Sourced from Google which pulls its data from this USDA link - Basic Report: 14221, Beverages, OCEAN SPRAY, Diet Cranberry Juice. Tinker around and youll find the other types. The values are for 100 grams. This is best because g can be directly derived from an SI unit. Measure the amount of pulp. If your grounds are already wet, you have coffee pulp. Figure out how much you have by weighing it on a scale; it will help if you keep the pulp in the filter so that it does not spread and create a mess. Convert the pulp into dry measurements. Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp. Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp. Voila! Provided you are pretty skilled at handling and measuring things, you have an accurate answer. :)\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 24.0 \t\t In case the question is relevant to the coffee beverage: The well-known recipe for the ground coffee to coffee beverage ratio is around 1:20. One pound is equivalent of 453.6 grams. Therefore; you may expect to have 9072 grams of brewed beverage. When you assume that a cm3 coffee beverage is around 1 grams, yo should have a bit more than 9 liters of beverage. Again, this makes around 320 oz. beverage. If you assume that your cups are 10 oz, you should end up with 32 cups of beverage from 1 pound of ground coffee. I admit that, using such a unit system makes it way harder than stating 1 kg coffee ends up two hundred 100 ml cups, at once. In case the question is relevant to the density of coffee: (Updated after Pauls comment) The solution is simpler as it depends solely on the density of coffee. Still, we may require a series of unit conversions. The density of ground coffee is around 0.32 gr/cm3. This means, 453.6 grams (one pound) of coffee has a volume around 1.42 l. This volume is roughly 50 oz. Finally, a cup is 8 to 12 oz, lets say 10 oz on average. Therefore, a pound of coffee should be more or less 5 cups of coffee. Note: This density is for ground beans. Green coffee beans has a density around 0.56 gr/cm3.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 18.5 \t\t Ground coffee density is 365 kg/m³, so its 2,72 times less dense than water, therefore 5 ml of ground coffee means 1.83 g, which equals to 22 mg of caffeine if the concentration is 1,2%.\n",

            "\t [2] \t\t 17.6 \t\t Yes, its perfectly safe to drink and extremely delicious. In The Philippines, we often call this Kopi Alamid, and it truly is one of the rarest coffees on the planet. At around $20 per 75 grams (local price), its also one of the worlds most expensive coffees. The palm civet is a nocturnal cat (well, more like a ferret, but technically a cat) that eats the berries (beans) and is extremely picky in its diet. For the civet to choose a bean, it has to be just right when it comes to the aroma, and given the sensitivity of this creatures nose, said aroma means the bean is perfect. Some say the digestive process itself lends to better flavor, it can be a matter of heated debate depending on where you ask ;) The thing is, the cat doesnt digest the whole bean, just the outer pulp. Farmers follow them around and wait for nature to take its course, then the beans are processed in a very safe manner. Farmers typically get just a kilo or so a day, its quite an intensive process. I drink it as often as I can afford to do so, and I have never gotten sick. Its a partly fruity, partly nutty and just an all over cozy and relaxing taste that I highly recommend if youre able to get the coffee. Just be prepared to pay quite a bit, and ready to consume it quickly after getting it home (it does not keep as well as others, probably due to local transportation issues prolonging the time it takes from roasting to actually get to market). If you have a hand-powered burr grinder, I recommend using it and grinding pretty gingerly, even the heat of most ceramic grinders is enough to lose a little bit of the fruity taste youd otherwise get. Really, treat these beans like royalty, theyre that good. If you buy some, try to avoid buying from farms with captive civets - the growing popularity of this coffee has led to a cottage trapping industry, which is (unfortunately) likely to seriously endanger them soon.\n",

For example: if something says coffee is bad whats under the headline? Bad for rats when forcefed caffeine for a week and kept awake? Likewise for coffee, one of the best things to do if interested in the science is look for REVIEW articles, that have been carried out over the past couple years so the latest work is included - and see where the consensus is at - Thats one. The other is to look at those reviews in terms of areas - so coffee consumption over X mg may be completely bad - for a particular effect - but completely fine in another. Right now its difficult to find where coffee at normal levels (a few cups a day) has any real problems. and may have benefits For instance - this is a quote from a 2017 big review of studies on coffee https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/ Conclusion Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm. Robust randomised controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. Importantly, outside of pregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee could be tested as an intervention without significant risk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of fracture should possibly be excluded. Another review from 2017 - looking at impacts on health generally writes https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675917 For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3 - 4 cups/d providing 300 - 400 mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits. This review provides up-to-date information about coffee on health. Topics addressed include the cardiovascular system, liver diseases, and diabetes as well as gastrointestinal disorders. In both cases, you can see the consensus, when looking at a variety of areas that are related to health suggest coffee is pretty ok. Now if you want you can look into specific correlations like coffee and different types of cancer (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=coffee+cancer) - where intriguingly even here some work shows cancer cells in for instance collorectal cancer (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386640/) are inhibited by coffee - but thats if you get really intrigued with the topic.

            "\t [1] \t\t 24.6 \t\t A shot in this context usually means one ounce, or so, of espresso. So a cup of coffee with two extra shots would be a cup of coffee with approximately two ounces of espresso added.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.2 \t\t An espresso is a shot of coffee produced by forcing hot water at high pressure through coffee grounds. Often, the espresso is the base shot of coffee from which other coffee drinks are prepared, although it is also quite common to enjoy it on its own. An americano is a coffee drink made by pouring one espresso and then adding hot water on top of it. This hot water weakens the coffee a little and mitigates some bitter notes. It is also consequently a larger drink and retains its heat for longer. As Ivan mentions in the comments, you may also be interested in the long black.

            "\t [3] \t\t 21.8 \t\t A long (luongo) and a short (ristretto) shot have two key differences. The amount of coffee used virtually stays the same although it can increase slightly with a ristretto shot, as the grind is finer. The key similarity between these two shots and a normal shot is that the extraction time stays the same. The grind is altered to achieve this - coarser for a long shot and finer for a ristretto shot. This, ideally, alters the volume of water which can pass through the coffee. For a long shot, the volume should be twice that of a standard espresso shot and for a ristretto shot, the volume should be half that of a standard espresso shot. The temperature of the water remains the same.\n",

Its made by pulling espresso shots and adding them to hot (or cold if youre into that kind of thing) water. The flavors will be different as well. For example, drip coffee will tend to have a stronger flavor, while an Americano will usually be a bit smoother depending on how strong you make it.\n",
            "#> are all synths the same?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.8 \t\t In your question you talk about differing sounds of bands like alt-j, so I believe we need to talk about keyboards and synths. A common misconception is that keyboards are the same thing as a synth. Keyboards are often shipped out with permanent patches and thats it, some will have recordings of a sound that are played back when you press the key. A synth is an actual sound generator. It has oscillators that generate waves that are then mixed and put through FX and other tools to create an enormous palate of sounds (a bit like mixing paints for new colours). A good synth is specifically designed to shape the sound quickly and easily with lots of relevant knobs to access the parameters. A synth is a sound creating tool that you can program for the perfect sound. Creating a perfect sound is an art in itself and can take many hours, weeks even for each patch. Music with defining synth sounds will usually have been designed by someone with a lot of thought, care and attention. To get the sound you want, you need to go through some tutorials. Google Synth ADSR tutorial or something similar to get you started. Be careful with software synths as a lot can be weak sounding but there are some good ones. What you need to look for is something that allows you to EDIT the sound dramatically and not be confined to the parameters of a patch. (you will probably need a midi keyboard for this but some let you use your computer keyboard) Next up from software is a hardware synth. Depending on your style, you need to pick the right synth for your sound as there are substantial differences between makes and models.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.9 \t\t Part of the reason is that synths are most often used in electronic music, which is usually highly polyphonic and emphasizes the interactions between multiple layers instead of focusing on one sound. As a result, synth sounds arent created to be powerful across the entire realm of musical functions, but instead to do one thing really well and play nicely with other sounds. Another reason may be that pianos use different types of strings for different registers. For example, most pianos Ive seen use thin wires for the middle octaves, but thick springs or coils for the low bass. If pianos used the same type of string throughout their entire voices, the low and high notes would probably not be suitable for solo performances. In a sense, a piano is a couple of different string instruments, put together as one. In contrast, a synth is typically programmed to use the exact same algorithm for all its octaves, meaning that synths typically only sound good in a narrow register. So, for example, a bass synth will sound thin in high registers, while a lead synth would probably get very muddy and detuned in bass registers. To make a synth playable for a solo instrument, one would probably need to program it to behave slightly differently in different registers, like a piano.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.8 \t\t A synth is a machine that generates (synthesizes) sounds. There are many different types: old-school 80s style FM synthesizers, even more old-school modular synths like Moogs, software synthesizers that run on a computer, etc. Although some have a keyboard, that is not part of a synthesizer per se, thats just the controller. A controller is a thing that can send note and other information to a synthesizer. The vast majority are keyboard controllers, but there are also drum pads, software, breath controllers, etc. All a controller does is send performance information. Many controllers, especially keyboard ones, have built in synths, but they can usually also be used via midi cables to control other synths. For that matter, the synthesizer inside such hybrids can also be controlled by other controllers if desired. So, if you get a keyboard controller, you will need some kind of synth to control with it if you want sounds. Although there are many awesome hardware synths out there, they are expensive, and there are fantastic software options which are relatively cheap if you already have a computer. Buying a hybrid might give you somewhat more portability, but if you have a laptop, its not a huge difference. EDIT TO ADD: for the most part, musicians end up collecting many different synths and controllers, especially synths. Different synths have vastly different sounds and strengths. Some have exotic sounds, some specialize in recreating traditional instruments, some favor pads while others favor leads. The majority have at least a few of all of these categories and more.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between r&b and rock and roll?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 21.6 \t\t The term Rhythm and Blues or R&B was coined by Jerry Wexler (who went on to be a famous record company executive and producer) when he was working as a journalist at Billboard Magazine, circa 1952. (Wikipedia link). Billboard published a weekly chart displaying their estimates of the relative position of retail sales of single recordings which were also broadcast on radio stations with an African-American audience, and the chart was called Race (as in racially-oriented, or perhaps oriented to the minority race which in the United States of America meant African-Americans). Recordings made by and marketed and sold to African-Americans had previously been called race records. Wexler proposed the name Rhythm and Blues at a staff meeting of Billboard magazine when they discussed wanting to change the name of the Race chart to something else, and his suggestion was accepted. As was mentioned earlier, influential radio personality Alan Freed coined the term rock and roll circa the mid-1950s. Freed seems to have intended the usage to refer to music made by both African-American musicians and white musicians. Quickly, though, in popular usage in the United States of America, rock and roll came to refer to music of a certain style recorded by white musicians and marketed and sold to a white audience. Rhythm and Blues refers to music that was recorded by African-American musicians and marketed and sold to an African-American audience. Note that the key to this is the term marketed and sold. Both Rock and Roll and Rhythm and Blues came to be designations used by the commercial music industry to describe how the music was marketed and sold, and to whom it was marketed. Notwithstanding, there are certainly distinct artistic characteristics to each kind of music. Stylistically The rhythms used in the two styles are similar. I would note that rock and roll has usually involved simple instrumentation of bass, guitar, and drums, small ensembles, and strictly diatonic chord progressions (mostly just I, IV, V7 or bVII if mixolydian mode is used). R&B, on the other hand, freely incorporates the expanded harmonic palette of jazz chords, uses larger ensembles, and can be found frequently to incorporate keyboards, horn sections, woodwinds, and string orchestras. R&B also tends toward more mid-tempo and slow-tempo pieces. The rock singing style is straightforward and narrative, whereas the R&B singing style involves florid melisma and other embellishments. It can also be noted that female singers are much more prevalent in R&B than they are in rock, where male singers strongly predominate. There is also a lot of influence of hip-hop and rap found in R&B in the last fifteen or twenty years, whereas hip-hop and rap have a much more limited influence on rock (and country) in the same time period.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 18.3 \t\t Rock music is defined by rhythm, not melody. Rock is in 4/4 time with the heavy beats being 2 and 4. Rock and roll in the 50s has exactly this in common with all of your sub-genres that you consider to be rock today. Its that simple. Im constantly amazed at how many people around the world today have essentially only listened to rock music all their lives and dont realize that there are many other kinds of music today and throughout history that dont use 4/4 time with the heavy beats on 2 and 4 at all. The majority of Western music that is in 4/4 time, throughout history, has a different beat, where the heavy beat is 1, while 2, 3 and 4 are weak beats. (Examples are the whole of European classical music, contemporary Mexican pop music, like banda and norteño, of which there is a lot in my neighborhood, and dances like the foxtrot or tango). There is also a great deal of music in the world that uses time signatures other than 4/4, such as the waltz, in 3/4, or the minuet, in 6/8. If it is in 4/4 time and you clap along to it on the 2 and the 4, then its rock music, or one of other related forms with a broader history such as the blues, jazz, country, R&B (rhythm and blues), or gospel. All of these forms come down to us from the rhythm of African-Americans, whose ancestors exported this rhythm from its birthplace in Africa when they were forcibly relocated to the New World. Genres and sub-genres of rock notwithstanding, they all have this in common: the predominant rhythm is 4/4 with the heavy beats on 2 and 4. That is why all these sub-genres are called rock. Listen to other kinds of music that have nothing to do with rock, and youll understand that the world of music is vast, but that rock is a very narrow genre with a very short history that just happens to be really popular in your particular culture in the present.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 17.2 \t\t GENRE (in music) is the bed-rock, the DNA if you will, that a derivative style is derived from. Eg. Rock and Roll, is a STYLE of BLUES MUSIC. The derivative style must elementarty depart from a genre to become a genre of its own. All types of Rock and Roll are derivative styles (styles derived from a genre) Rock and Roll does not depart deeply enough from The Blues to be a musical genre of its own. Rock and Roll utilizes call and response tropes, polyrhythm, synchopation, is played in a purcussive manner and generally follows the 12 or 8 bar Blues form and the 1, 4, 5 chord progression. Therefore, Rock and Roll is a STYLE not a genre. (The giant list of derivative musics referred to as GENRES is mind boggling and rooted in consumerism) 80s music IS NOT A MUSICAL GENRE. Either is Trance, House, Funk, Trip-Hop, Hip Hop, jazz fusion, country rock, blues rock,disco, ect ect (ad nauseum). Blatent consumerism has distorted these designations for commercial purposes. Perhaps they would be better termed as LABELS and not styles of genres (JON-RAHS) at all. So, basically there are very few true musical genres. Most often, when one uses the term genre they are actually referring to a DERIVATIVE STYLE. Classical music is a genre. Polka, waltz, concertos, symphony, sonata, suite, étude, symphonic poem, opera, are all derivative styles of European classical music. One must examine the form and instrumentation of a music to help in determining whether it is a style or genre. Jazz is a genre. Meaning it has departed far enough from its blues roots to become a genre of its own. Folk music is a genre. True folk music of the world has been kept from the distortions and derivations of commercialism. Folk music has remained pure. What it boils down to is this, if a music has remained pure in form it continues to be referred to a GENRE, once it gets cross pollinated and and crossed over it becomes a derivative style.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between fender and squier?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.3 \t\t The main difference is in the price and the quality. The fender guitars are more expensive and tend to be of higher quality, whereas Squier guitars are made more cheaply and have lower quality. By this I dont mean that the Squier guitars are low quality and bad, but (usually) they are not so good as a Fender guitar. By good and low quality, I refer mostly to the sound, the playability and the durability of the guitar. A high quality guitar will be able to produce a high quality sound, whereas a low quality guitars sound will not. Similarly, a low quality guitar might not be that easy to play. Using low quality woods might cause pain on your arm, whereas a high quality guitar will have woods that are comfortable for your hands, so you can play for hours without getting any pain. Lastly, a low quality guitar isnt made to last a lifetime.1 The Squier guitars are being made in China and Indonesia, but in the 80s they manufactured them in Japan and they were of pretty good quality. If you look for used squier guitars from the 80s (on Ebay or something) youll see that they are more expensive than some new ones, and that they where made in Japan. The Fender guitars are made in the USA and receive more attention in the production. Some of the guitar parts might be of higher quality (not necessarily all of them), but what makes the quality better is the whole production. You should also look into the Mexican Fender Guitars. They are somewhat above the Squier models and somewhat below the American ones, both pricewise and qualitywise. Again, not every model will be like this. If you have time, you go in depth in this article: Squier vs Fender Stratocaster Guitar Review. It shows many different squier and fender models and it explains whats up with everyone. 1Keep in mind, that a beginner wont easily notice all these differences. Thats why many people start off with these kind of guitars (like me). They are great for someone who doesnt want/cannot spend a lot of money on guitars just yet, so a cheap solution is a good choice in this case.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.2 \t\t Before addressing the question directly, a short, simplistic and far from complete list of things that make a good guitar: it makes good sounds it doesnt make bad sounds (or when it does, theyre not the guitars fault) its comfortable to play its consistently in tune up and down the fingerboard it stays in tune the above points remain true ten years after you bought it, and without expensive maintenance/repair So Fenders meet those criteria and Squiers dont? Of course thats not always true. Its impossible to boil down to a single difference between Fenders and Squiers, because both badges cover such a range of price and quality, and there can even be some overlap between them. The best answer I can think of is consistency. The higher up the range you go, the better the quality control, and the less likely you are to find a lemon. Buy an American made Fender Strat, and youre pretty much guaranteed a good guitar, and with a little care it will stay a good guitar for as long as you need it to. At the opposite end of the market, buy a Squier Bullet Strat and if youre lucky you might get a good one, but more likely you will have a playable beginners guitar (as long as its been set up properly in the shop). The neck wont feel as good as the Fender, the sound wont be as good, and it wont stay in tune as well. After a few months youll wonder why the sound keeps cutting out and youll figure out you need to keep tightening the nut on the input jack. If you dont know what scratchy pots are, chances are you soon will. Those are the extremes. The water gets muddier when you compare the top end Squiers and the low end Fenders. Things also get more subjective, so Ill not say much more. FWIW, heres my recent experience. I sold my Fender USA Strat a couple of years ago. After 20 years it was still going strong. I wanted a Telecaster, and I looked at the Mexican Fenders and the top Squiers. The Fenders were mostly pretty good, and generally better than the Squiers I tried, but after going round a few shops the guitar I liked best happened to be the cheapest Id looked at, a 50s Squier Classic Vibe. Whether or not it will still be going strong in a decade or two remains to be seen, but for now I like my Squier, dare I say, better than I ever liked my Fender.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.0 \t\t You hit the nail on the head. Vintage in this context means they are building the guitars a similar way they did back in the day but with some modifications. These modifications can be better woods, pickups, parts, etc. I always thought vintage meant 15+ years old. Some say 25+, but it doesnt really matter. Vintage doesnt dictate value (as you can clearly see from these two guitars you are looking into). I would guess that the Fender model probably has better parts/build but that is just from my experience. There are plenty of awesome Squier guitars though. Typically with most Fender guitars you should not have any issues swapping parts between the two. However, Fender to Squier, your best bet would be to ask a luthier or a guitar tech.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between major 2nd and minor 2nd?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.0 \t\t A minor second is a semi tone closer to the root note than a Major Second. D - Eb is a Minor Second. D to E is a Major second. As a general rule of thumb if you have a Major interval and you bring the notes closer to each other by either raising the bottom note or lowering the top note by a semi tone then you have a minor interval.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.8 \t\t The major intervals 2, 3, 6, and 7 come indeed from the major scale. However, as you noted, the corresponding minor intervals do not come from the (natural) minor scale, because then there wouldnt be any minor 2nd interval. All minor intervals can be obtained from the descending major scale. If we use C major as an example, a minor 2nd is the interval between C and the B below the C. A minor third is the interval from C down to A, a minor 6th from C down to E, and, finally, a minor seventh from C down to D. Equivalently, you get all the minor intervals (2, 3, 6, 7) from the phrygian mode, which is an inverted major scale in the sense that the sequence of intervals when ascending is the same as the sequence of intervals of a descending major scale.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.8 \t\t A major second interval consists of 2 semitones (or as you say a whole step) whereas a minor second interval consists of a semitone.

Of the second intervals only the major second consists of a whole step.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between a scale and a mode?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 27.5 \t\t I miss the fundamental distinction between scale and mode in the answers here. A scale is an ordered set of notes (usually functionally repeating after an octave). A mode is the harmonic framework built from it. The difference is similar to that of floor tiles and a floor. Even if the floor contains nothing but floor tiles, it is conceptually different from the constituting tiles. A mode is basically what you get from making musical and harmonic sense of a scale, putting the notes into relation with each other focused on the respective tonic, and using the various notes of the scale to build a harmonic framework.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 26.2 \t\t A scale is a set of notes. For instance, the D Dorian scale contains the notes D, E, F, G, A, B, C, and D. A mode is a scale or scales with musical functions attached to the notes. For example, the Dorian mode of Gregorian chant (sample here) has D is the tonic A is the reciting note (listen 1:34) B is often replaced by B-flat, especially in progressions leading downward to A. The remaining notes are unstable and gravitate toward the lower D. For another example, the minor mode of classical music consists of natural, harmonic, and melodic forms with downward and upward tendencies attached to the 6ths and 7ths.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 25.3 \t\t The term mode is often the subject of confusion, but its really quite simple: Mode in the musical sense means a manner or fashion of playing a scale. There is no absolute difference between a mode and a scale: Every scale has a given key signature and one can play any ordered collection of 7 notes using that key signature - start on any note in the chromatic octave (which has no accidentals) and play a conventional 7 note scale, following the key signature - you now have a whats called a scale or mode. Mode is a relative term: when you decide, for whatever reason, to make one particular note your root, that pattern is called the scale, and becomes a parent scale, as it were, to its other modes: Building a scale with the same key signature but using a different root than the parent root becomes a mode: A different fashion/manner of playing the parent scale. So using the example of C Ionian - which we call the C Major Scale, the 6th mode of that scale - a scale that starts on the 6th degree of the parent scale, (whose key signature has no sharps and no flats) in this case A - becomes the Aeolian mode, commonly known as the A Minor Scale. But note that C major also has a modal name: Ionian. In fact, if we decide that A Aeolian is the parent scale, C Ionian would then be considered the third mode of A Minor. And so it goes with all modes and scales. Because today we tend to think of the C Major and A Minor Scales as the basis for our tonal system, everything else we refer to as modes, but its by no means so clear-cut, and in truth its simpler than one might think.\n",
            "#> are nylon and steel strings interchangeable?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.5 \t\t What were your previous strings made out of? If they werent steel, you shouldnt be putting steel strings on instead, coated or not. Steel and nylon string guitars arent interchangeable.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.8 \t\t In theory, you could. In practice, however, not necessarily - at least not without some problems. Steel and nylon strings are mounted differently. Nylon strings are simply tied around the bridge, while steel strings have ball-ends that are pulled up against the bridge by string tension. In most steel string acoustics, the strings are held in place by tapered friction pins that push the ball-end beneath the soundboard, thus securing the bridge end of the string in place. Putting nylon strings on such a bridge might be very difficult (simply tying strings around the pins might not work, since friction is the only thing that holds the pins in place). If your guitar has a tailpiece of some sort that the strings pass through, you might be able to tie the nylon strings around that, although it may not be as easy as with a dedicated classical bridge. On the headstock end, steel string capstans are generally shorter and narrower, accounting for both the lesser thickness and better grip of steel strings. You might be able to secure nylon strings onto the tuning pegs nevertheless, but you might experience string slippage and associated tuning problems. Of course, there are other issues involved as well - such as those mentioned by @Dr Mayhem and @Judv. Steel-string acoustic guitars are constructed to deal with higher string tension and thus may not respond to nylon strings like a classical guitar. All things considered, its generally a good idea to stick with the purpose the guitar was designed for.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.6 \t\t Another problem with adding steel strings to nylon string guitars comes in the form of how far from the neck the string is. A steel string guitar has the string very close to the neck so that it is playable, whilst a nylon string guitar has it a fair way from the neck so that it plays louder. There is quite a bit of theory involved here, but in simple terms, the nylon string guitar that has steel strings on it, if it was able to cope with the forces, would be very hard to play and not sound great at all.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between musical meaning and function?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.3 \t\t Function means role or responsibility; its closer to the ordinary meaning, different from the specialized math term which means mapping between two sets. Western music theory works by identifying and classifying certain recurring patterns in music, such as certain chord cadences. When we say that some chord has a function, we are stating (the hypothesis) that the segment of music seems to fit some well-known pattern, and the chord is an element in that pattern. It is functioning as a piece of that pattern. Each piece of the pattern has a job, and so if we know which piece of which pattern that harmony is, we can say that its doing that job. Sometimes there are ambiguities: more than one pattern applies to a segment of music. Sometimes that is deliberate; patterns overlap, so that for instance the ending harmony of one pattern doubles as the start of the next one. So then the same chord might have multiple functions at the same time.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.3 \t\t Contrary to what many people seem to think here, to me the definition of function is exactly the same in mathematics and music (and computer science). Lets look at the definition from dictionary.com: function: a relation between two sets in which one element of the second set is assigned to each element of the first set Now this may confuse people, since were talking about sets here, so just to be certain were all on the same page: (also from dictionary.com) set: a collection of objects or elements classed together What is slightly misleading here is that the above definition very much implies tangible concepts, but obviously in mathematics a set can be infinite and/or abstract etc. (E.g. the set of positive integers) So, what does this have to do with music? Lets start with set. The chromatic notes are clearly a set (of frequencies). We noticed that within that set we can identify subsets, with a very interesting quality: we can actually describe a set of intervals, which we call scales. If we move the order of the intervals in that set around, we call them modes. Thats one way of identifying sets withing music, lets call these the vertical sets. But there are other sets to be found: regardless of which scale we used, we noticed that certain interval progressions lead to the same emotions. We wanted to name these (and thereby created sets) and decided upon tonic, subdominant, etc. These are the horizontal sets. So in fact the word dominant describes a set: all the fifth elements within scales. Alright, now lets get to function. Lets look at the mathematical definition again: a relation between two sets in which one element of the second set is assigned to each element of the first set For example we have the following two sets: 1) [C, D, E, F, G, A, B] 2) [G, A, B, C, D, E, F#] So what are these two sets? (some of) the tonics of the (major) scales are set 1. (and coincidentally it also constitutes the C major scale) And set 2 are the dominants. I.e. what Ive done here is I took the tonics of these major scales (vertical sets) and put them together into set 1 (a horizontal set) Then I took the dominants of the same major scales and put those into set 2 TL/DR; So the function here is the relation between the tonic and the dominant. In the vertical set of the C major scale, C functions as the tonic to the dominant G. (Which would not be the case for the F major, since there C functions as the dominant to the tonic F) To lead it back to the mathematical definition: the first element in set 1 is assigned to the first element in set 2. etc. Now, how you want to describe that function is entirely up to you. (i.e. it leads, sounds like home, etc. etc.) Sidenote: of course the function of a teacher is to teach. Set 1 is all the teachers, set 2 is all the students, what is the relation between those two sets? The teachers teach to the students, i.e. their function is to teach.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.8 \t\t EDIT Im revising my answer, because from OP comments I now understand the question isnt simply about Riemann function. I see potentially three definitions for function: Riemann function, mathematical function, function meaning purpose. ...But I wonder how you would explain it to a curious student... To the extent there is a problem, that problem seems to be with the word it. Explain it. Explain what exactly? Explain Riemann function? Explain a math-like function concept in music? Explain the purpose (function) of musical devices? If the word function is used with students, and we switch back and forth between the various meanings of the word, some students might get confused. Personally, when I hear function in musical context I think either Riemann function or the general meaning purpose. I dont think of the math term which in plain English means something like procedure. If someone is confused about the meaning of function, you probably need to clear up which definition is being used. As far as the math meaning is concerned, I like the example sentence: the position of a planet is a function of time. We could apply that to some musical processes and add the general meaning purpose. The inversion of a melody is a function of direction and melodic inversion is used to develop new, thematically related material. An inversion function would take a series of intervals and directions and return the same set of intervals with all the directions reversed. A harmonic sequence is a function of transposition and sequential harmony can be used to move to a new key. A harmonic sequence function would take a two chord progression and an interval of transposition and return the original two chords followed by two more chords whose roots are located the interval of transposition away from the original two chords. Syncopation is a function of rhythm and syncopated rhythm is used to create excitement. A syncopation function could take a melodic fragment and change metrical rhythmic patterns to contra-metric values without changing the pitches. So from these examples, to invert, to sequence, and to syncopate are all functions in the mathematical sense that output of the process is determined by the input. In plain English these functions are all verbs. Can Reimann function be described as a function in the mathematical sense that the output of such a function is determined by the input? I say no. We really understand a chords Riemann function only after knowing where the chord goes. If the input is chords C G Am ...what would a Riemann function determine is the output? Riemann function is about the succession of chords. Any sensible Riemann function process would provide the next chord as output. But, we dont know where the music is going. It could modulate. More importantly we have know way to if the next chord should be functional according to Riemann function. In other words: Riemann function is not a musical procedure - the mathematical meaning of function - but a description of existing harmony. ...What does “function actually mean in music? To the extent that function in music will be understood by some as Riemann function it is merely a description of harmony. Music can be described as functional or non-functional. ...I remember when the term function was introduced in math - y=f(x) Riemann function is not one of those functions. ...tonic and dominant also are functions... No, they arent. If we use the mathematical meaning of function, tonic and dominant are not processes. They are properties of chords in the Riemann model. We could have a mathematical function called tonicize but that is something different. After applying a tonicize function to a chord we could then refer to the chords tonic property and it being the tonic of a tonality. So, if we really want to be mathematical about this, the common musical concept of a chords function is a property, a description, an adjective. It is not a mathematical function, it isnt a process, it isnt a verb. http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/search?q=function https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) https://www.google.com/search?q=function+definition My original answer... I suppose it works like this in my mind: Example, there are chords Dm, G7, and Am... I can place them into a key C major... The (Riemann) functions are basically the chord root identities labelled with Roman numerals ii, V7, and vi, further I can give general labels of pre-dominant, dominant, and (I selected vi on purpose) a non-tonic chord which gets shoe-horned into the Riemann function system as another pre-dominant. If the Am had been C we would have the tonic and very neatly fulfilled the expected Riemann functions... Riemann function is also described as a flow of events: pre-dominant, to dominant, to tonic. Depending on the rhythmic phrasing I could say the harmony forms a deceptive cadence. Normally, that is the end of the Riemann analysis story. But, as I understand the question, the issue is not about the labels, but rather what is the purpose fulfilled by the functions? So, in the Riemann sense: what is the function of harmony? answer to lead to and form a cadence. Notice that I specify cadence and not chord progression. If we take something like V6 IV6 iii6 ii6 I6/4 V7 I, the initial chords in the progression dont fulfill Riemann function, but the ending does. To me, the essential functional part is the cadential part. Something similar could be said about sequential harmony where the sequential passage is a shifting of the tonal center - indeed, pivot chords get two labels - after the sequence a cadential passage confirms tonality at which point function becomes clear. Whether any of this is satisfying intellectually or musically is another matter. My attitude about functional harmony - and harmony textbooks - changed a lot after I read Gjerdingens Music in the Galant Style which turned me on to figured bass and solfege. Why should Riemann function trump rhythm and metrical function, or the function of consonance/dissonance and stability/unstability? All of which gets short shrift in most textbooks compared to Roman numeral analysis. Whats the function of a chord or harmony? Answer: to express yourself musically! Why does some music lead to cadences? Answer: because that is the convention is those styles!\n",

            "\t [2] \t\t 18.3 \t\t In my opinion, allowing either person to select the piece opens the door to blatant cheating (pre-preparation). Far better to have the director select a piece at random. (As a possible alternative, specify a permanent set of, say, four pieces for each instrument that will always be used for challenges, so that every member can be properly prepared. ) I do wonder why you are being specific about marching bands, as chair challenges can take place in any large ensemble, and the protocols for a fair audition process should be the same.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 18.2 \t\t When its time for a jazz tune to end, the bandleader may raise their index finger in the air which means Play the melody one more time and then end. In string bands, raising a foot means, When you finish this time through the tune, end the tune or start the next tune in the medley. If a group is playing a medley and a number of the members are playing the medley for the first time, the bandleader may show 3 fingers up which means the next tune has 3 sharps or 2 fingers down which means the next tune has 2 flats as @LaurencePayne says in his answer. The bandleader may then signal the changes to rest of the band using the number of fingers to signify the scale degree of the root of the chords. In my band either the fiddler or the guitar player will signal tempo by moving the neck of their instrument. Side-to-side means Go slower and up-and-down means Go faster. If Im sitting, then standing up means Watch me. If were doing a big splashy rock finish, Ill take a hop or jump off of a chair to signal the final thump of the ending. Staring or pointing at a musician means Take a solo. Rotating a hand towards the end of the solo means Solo another time through. Staring and nodding in time at the drummer means, Go at this exact tempo. In folk ensembles often a foot in the air means, End at the end of this section.

            "\t [1] \t\t 26.4 \t\t Yes, tempo refers mainly to the speed of a song or piece. BPM is the standard, objective way of measuring the tempo of a song or piece. It isnt the right way but rather a right way of measuring tempo. BPM stands for beats per minute. However, you cant measure the speed of a piece by number of notes in a minute. A note is a single pitch, and it can be held for as long (or as short) as denoted by the composer. Because not all notes are held for the same amount of time, you cant measure tempo with the number of notes in a minute (or the number of notes in any period of time). In the song you linked, the notes sound very fast because their values are very short, and also at a pretty fast tempo.\n",

BPM stands for beats per minute; its the musical equivalent of miles per hour, and it is the standard way of measuring the tempo of a composition. But the tempo is different from how many notes are played. A piece with a very fast tempo could use relatively few notes, whereas a very slow piece could use many many notes. To go back to the miles per hour analogy, imagine driving 60 miles an hour but only passing two trees. Now imagine driving 1 mile an hour and passing 100 trees. Which is the best measurement of speed, miles per hour or trees per hour? This is why its more common to measure the BPM of a piece instead of the number of notes per minute.\n",

            "#> are usb mics any good?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.4 \t\t It really depends on what type of quality youre looking for. I would highly suggest an audio interface with a good condenser mic, and possibly a pair of cardoid mics. The convenience of a USB mic is good, but audio interfaces are quite small and are not a hassle at all. Its better to record with the audio interface, because you can potentially record at a higher bit depth and get better quality. The other upside to using an audio interface, is that if you get one that supports multiple mics, you can connect more than one mic and capture your instruments from different points simultaneously, which usually helps to create a richer sound, especially for an instrument like a guitar. You should look into the focusrite scarlett audio interface series. They have different models that come with a different number of inputs. The focusrite scarlett audio interfaces are affordable and produce excellent results. Theyre USB powered. As far as condenser mics, good ones will run up high in cost pretty quickly. However, a decent condenser mic paired with an audio interface can still produce some impressive results.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.3 \t\t You definitely will want a good external microphone. There are several types available, from the usual sources. I recommend you begin your search by looking for a good lapel mic to start with. They plug in to your regular 1/8 jack, just like the earbuds with microphones in them, but are of much greater quality. They work well, and you would want to clip it on to the shirt of the singer and let it pick up the piano in the background. Here is the one I use: Quality Lavalier Lapel Clip On Microphone For about the same price you can go el-cheapo and try a small add-on microphone for your phone like this one: Olympus Noise Cancelling Microphone - I havent tried this because I like to have a cord between my tablet and the microphone so I dont get rustling noises as I control the tablet. Another option is to get one that can plug into the USB port. I have good success with one of those. I am using a tablet with a regular USB port so cant really address how well it would work on a phone. At the very least you would need an adapter that allows a full-size USB plug to go into your phone. Not all USB mics can work with phones, but here is a decent one that might work: USB Microphone with stand In your question you mention that you are looking for the best quality. Obviously, the best answer would be to set up an actual mixer so you can have separate microphones for the piano and the singer. They are not all that expensive, and if you are serious about recording you may well decide it is worth it. To use a mixer you would want an adapter cable for the output that can plug in to the 1/8 microphone port on the phone, plus microphones and their associated cables. (To professionally mic a piano, you want the microphone to be inside. For a grand piano, I open the top then use a microphone stand to position the microphone about a foot above the sounding board near the center) Here is one inexpensive example: Audio Mixer - It takes some setting up but this is how the studios do it. You asked about apps. Instead of suggesting one in particular, Id suggest you go to the play store and look around. There are a lot available, and they can help with effects and other parameters. Try some and see if you think they help. You might find one that you like. I have tried some but still use the stock recording app that came with my tablet. There are also some good playback apps that can do things like boost your bass or give full equalization control. Those are good for listening to any kind of music. But in the end, I dont use them. Instead, I picked up an excellent Bluetooth speaker: OontZ Angle 3 that provides very good sound all by itself. It is well worth the price. I use it all the time. In summary, I would suggest you start with the lapel microphone first, then go from there. 1) you know for sure it will work with your phone. 2) they are easy to use, 3) the price is right, 4) they produce surprisingly good recordings. In the final analysis, nothing beats getting a good recording in the first place, so step one is to find a decent microphone that suits you. But playback is also important, so step two is to get a good speaker system that enhances the sound.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.1 \t\t In theory, you already have all you need. The upside of a USB mic is that it does the conversion from analog to digital for you, so no separate mic preamp is needed. Once in the digital domain, then to all intents & purposes one DAW is as good as any other. What you would gain from a better DAW is in the editing, mixer bay & audio plugin areas - though Audacity has equivalents for a lot of those. A better DAW starts to become a necessity once you exhaust the possibilities of your existing setup. Theres a lot of mileage in your freeware setup; work with it, experiment with plugins - compressors, reverbs, EQ - etc. - until you are sure you have extracted the most from it thats possible... then look at the paid options. If, as it sounds, you are doing what is effectively adding a vocal track to karaoke then you may never actually need to step up to a paid solution.\n",
            "#> are all guitar capos the same?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.3 \t\t First of all, putting a capo on does not change the temperament of your guitar. Your guitar temperament is equal temperament so and thats not changing so forget about the temperament aspect of this.. The only thing it does is change what strings are Open. So without a capo, your open strings are the typical E-A-D-G-B-E. For every fret you move it, all your open strings go up one fret so putting it on the first fret would give you the notes F-A#-D#-G#-C-F. So now if you have the same chord shape it will be the same type of chord, but have a different root. You can also think of by the typical chord diagrams. This is an Em chord: Em This is an Fm chord: Fm This is an F#m chord: F#m See how the F#m chord is one just 1 fret up from the Fm chord and the Fm chord is one just 1 fret up from the Em chord ? This is no coincidence since every minor chord has the same formula you can use the same shape to make the same type of chord.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.0 \t\t Same reason, really, as to why some guitarists need/have to use capos. If Im playing a song in concert B, Im happy doing that. Another guitarist might prefer to capo on 2nd fret and play it in his mind, in A. Generally, all guitarists will tune to concert, but if one decides hed rather play a tone lower, for better sound, etc., then hell tune differently and compensate. It may well be that youve already been party to this, but not even realised - theres no good reason why you should - everyone is effectively in the same key, so it isnt apparent.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.9 \t\t There are many different styles and types of capo, all with the same end product in mind. However, they do differ a lot. Some are dead straight, to work with flat fingerboards. Others have a radius which approximately matches the fingerboard radius on cambered fingerboards. The way they attach to the neck varies too, and some are very easy to move up and down, while others need adjustment. Those with a spring for tension cannot be adjusted, so may, on some guitars, squeeze too hard and put the guitar out of tune, necessitating retuning for each position change. But they store easily on the head of the guitar when not being used. I dont use capos often, but prefer G7,(not the cheapest!) which can be attached with as much or little pressure as needed. There are many different designs, so its worth trying several out. Take guitar to shop. Until youve tried them out, you really wont know whether it was hard sell or good sell. The cheapest is a pencil and rubber band - yes, it works - right through to a Spider, which takes things to a different level.\n",
            "#> are barre chords easier on electric guitar?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 27.4 \t\t Long term success with barre chords comes from repetition and proper form. Be sure your thumb is directly behind your barre finger when you form the chord. To make the repetition part more enjoyable by allowing for success as you build strength and refine your technique, you might consider some of the ideas below. To make things easier (especially with the F Barre chord) as you build strength, try tuning the guitar a half or whole step flat which will reduce the string tension and make it easier to play barre chords. If you dont want to play your songs a step flat, then put a capo on the first or second fret (depending on if you are a half or whole step flat) and this will make it even easier to play a full six string F Barre chord because the fret becomes the nut and is much closer to the next fret than the nut is to the first fret. Lighter gauge strings will make barre chords easier to play as will a proper set up on your guitar. The lower the action, the easier it will be to play barre chords. If you try different guitars, you may find one that is much easier to play barre chords on. Of course an electric is easier to play than an acoustic where barre chords are concerned. But various acoustics have different construction characteristics which make them easier or harder to play barre chords. The nut height makes a big difference when it comes to the relative ease of playing an F Barre Chord at the first fret. If you try this with a bunch of guitars at your local music store you will find differing degrees of tension required to cleanly fret an F Barre at the first fret. If a new guitar is not in the cards, try lighter strings and de-tune half or whole step and use a capo. Soon you will be playing the F barre chord as easily as a G chord and you can gradually move to heavier strings and/or the tighter tension of standard tuning. The idea is to gradually build strength while successfully playing the chord - as opposed to grappling with the frustration of not being able to cleanly play the chord you are trying to play. Good luck.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.9 \t\t Bending a tune sounds like a bad idea. Then youd just have one of the notes out of tune. Not OK. Your options: Practice more! But while you havent got it nailed yet: Use another inversion/grip like an A-string-based barre chord on the 3rd fret. Barre chords are often a better fit for modern rock electric guitars anyway. (my opinion only) If/when the C chord has an open high E string, then you can just mute the D string and not worry about it. You got all the needed notes C - E - G sounding already. (Even the G isnt absolutely needed, and you could do a C major with just a C and E note sounding. Or if theres a bass player playing C, the guitar only has to play an E.)\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 25.7 \t\t Heres something else... As noted, a lot of beginners have problems with barre chords generally. Aside from finger placement, something else to consider is the setup of the instrument. This shouldnt be a big problem with an electric, but many guitars are shipped with an unnecessarily-high action. If the action at the nut is too high, playing any first-position barre chord will be harder than it needs to be.\n",
            "#> are there different capos for different guitars?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.7 \t\t Most of them will probably work, but there sure are some differences. Fingerboard shape: theres a rough distinction in flat fingerboards (most nylonstring guitars) and curved (steelstring). Using a curved capo on a classical guitar will either excert unnecessary pressure to the outer strings, or fail to press the inner ones down reliable; vice versa a flat capo may result in either detuning of the inner strings through too much, or rattling on the bass strings through too little pressure. Related: different guitars have different neck widths. Standard capos wont work on sevenstring guitars (at least not on all strings). But most capos will have the right size to work on almost any normal sixstring guitar. Some capos (e.g. Dunlop Trigger) just press down the strings with a spring, which can be very quickly released with one hand. Others (e.g. Shubb) can be adjusted to fit the neck thickness, which can solve some intonation- or buzzing problems, but is also slightly more fiddly. (I think some capos even let you fine-tune the shape.) Several cheap models just clamp the neck with some kind of ratched mechanism, which is neither really stable nor very accurate nor easy to set up. As with all music purchases, the best thing is to try out the available models, see what fits well your guitar.\n",

            "\t [3] \t\t 23.6 \t\t Thats a great question! There are in fact many different types of capo and they all have advantages and disadvantages. I own at least 6 different kinds. I will highlight the main differences and advantages of each. As Leftaroundabout explained, no matter which style/type capo you get, you want it to match your fretboard for width and curvature. Beyond getting that part right lets talk about your options and the advantages of each. The most commonly used capo in my part of the world among all the musicians I know is one of the spring clamp varieties also known as quick change capos. A popular version of this type capo is made by Kyser (see picture below). This type capo has a spring in it and you open it to put it on the guitar neck by squeezing the trigger (these are sometimes referred to as a trigger capo). Releasing the pressure allows the capo to clamp on the guitar neck with spring tension. It works much like a spring operated clothes pin. The reason many performing musicians use this type is that it can be installed, removed and repositioned very quickly with one hand. There are no screws to tighten or levers to latch. Also it can be clamped on the headstock or mic stand or music stand for easy accessibility during the performance. The disadvantage of this type capo is that you cannot adjust the tension. A similar capo that I prefer is known as a dual action capo like the one made by Planet Waves pictured below. This capo works much the same as the Kyser style spring clamp in that you can store it on the headstock and install and remove it with one hand. But it has a tension adjustment knob that allows you to adjust the tension for your guitar. Different guitars have different neck thicknesses and the dual action capo allows you to adjust the amount of pressure on the strings so that you have just enough to get all strings ringing clearly with no muting but not so much that the strings are pinned tight against the fret board and pulled out of tune. Another capo I own is a Paige Capo - pictured below. What I like best about this capo is that it is very thin (the thinnest I am aware of). It gives your fingers more room for chords such as a B7 where you are fretting on the first and second fret using all four fingers. Another advantage is that the tension is adjustable for the exact amount needed to deliver clean sounding open strings with no more tension than necessary. It can be fined tuned better than the dual action because there is no spring tension involved. The disadvantage of the Paige capo is that it takes two hands to install or remove or move it. You must open the lever with one hand while holding on to the capo with the other hand. Also, if you move the capo up the neck where it is thicker, you have to adjust the tension screw. I use this capo when I am going to be playing most songs in my performance with the capo in the same position. Its also the best capo to use if you want to reduce overall string tension by shortening the scale of your guitar by tuning a half step flat and leaving the capo on the first fret all the time. Another thin bar capo that allows more room for certain chords but is a tad more easily moved than the Paige - is the Shubb (pictured below). Like the Paige, this one does not use a spring (uses a type of lever action) so the tension can be fine tuned, but it has a trigger style release that allows for one handed removal (although installing it with one hand is rather tricky). It takes less time to install than the Paige, once you adjust the tension screw properly for your guitar. Another adjustable tension capo with a sleek design is the G-7th Capo (pictured below). This capo works with an internal ratchet type mechanism. You place it on the neck and press down on the string bar as far as needed to get clean tone and the mechanism holds it in that position until you release it with the release lever. This allows you to install and remove it with one hand as long as you are not too clumsy. It takes getting used to how hard to squeeze it to get the correct tension, but some folks seem to love this capo. If you are on a budget, the capo pictured below is very inexpensive and does the job and is very light weight. And if you are on a really tight budget, the elastic band type capo is quite versatile in terms of fitting many different type guitars. It is not fine tunable and it takes two hands and one leg and an elbow to install and remove. Once you get your capo, you will find the chart in the link below very useful for determining where to place the capo for various transpositions. What Key Corresponds to Various Capo Positions\n",
            "#> what is the difference between beat and pulse?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.0 \t\t A pulse is the heartbeat of the rhythm/music that you hear - and feel - when listening to music and this is what people usually tap along to when listening. The beat is the repeated note value of the time signature. They can often (and are usually) the same thing, or at least they cross over. However I shall give some examples: In a piece with time sig 4/4, the beat is 4 crotchet beats every bar. The pulse is most likely also going to be this however if some notes are more pronounced you may tap your foot 2 beats/bar. In a piece with time sig 6/8, the beat is 6 quaver beats/bar whereas the pulse is usually 2 beats/notes at intervals of dotted crotchets. It will be felt as: 1-and-a-2-and-a, 1-and-a-2-and-a, etc. where 1 is where you tap your foot, the pulse.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.8 \t\t Pragmatically: the Beat is mostly for writing purposes. Pulse is often used synonymously with beat and if I start clapping a pulse, or beat, you wouldnt know if its a quarter-note or an eighth-note etc. It is a pulse, an undefined beat. It has a tempo but not necessarily the same as the song tempo. We get the song tempo once we decide what the beat is. EXAMPLE: I clap a pulse at 80 BPM. I then decide the song has a double-time feel so the pulse is half notes; quarter notes are 160 BPM, the tempo is 160 BPM. In other words the pulse is the feel of the song. The way you choose to write it gives the value of the beat and the tempo. Pulse has a BPM but it might differ from the beat because of the way you want to write the music notes.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.9 \t\t You are right in saying a beat is the steady pulse that underlies the music. The notes exist within this framework. One note may be several beats long.

But if you are just looking for a rhythmic instrument that can provide a wide variety of rhythmic sounds in a band, the Cajon will probably be a good alternative. At the end, it also depends on what type of music you play. If you try it you will find out if this suits your music. It can even become the little extra that makes your music unique and different from others.\n",

Hi-hat can operate as a poor mans cymbals in a pinch. For venues with a basic backline kit, all youll need is your sticks and bass drum pedal, although you will probably prefer your own cymbals. Some folks will use a cocktail kit: Still other folks such as jazz drummer Jarrod Kaplan can make an effective drumkit sound with a djembe and rattles and bells on the ankles. A variant on the djembe idea is to use a Cajon with rattles and bells on the ankles. Another possibility is a travel drumkit with nesting drums.\n",
            "#> what are nylon tip drumsticks for?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.3 \t\t When you choose a drumstick, you want to take into consideration: 1. The matierial of the drumstick 2. The weight and the thickness of the drumstick 3. The material of the tip 4. The shape of the tip 5. The length of the stick 1. You can get nylon ones, but, these are usually much more expensive and most beginners wont notice a difference between them and wooden sticks (except for the substance feel). I would personally recommend wooden-made sticks and the best wood for beginners is probably hickory. If you dont want (for some strange reason) hickory drumsticks, you should get maple sticks. 2. You will see drumsticks are measured using a number then a letter. The number represents the weight of the stick - the higher the number, the lighter the stick - and the letter represents the thickness - the further up in the alphabet, the thicker the stick. You would use a lighter and thinner stick for jazz and blues drums, a medium size and weight for rock and pop, a thicker and heavier stick for heavy rock and metal. A beginner would be good using a 5A which is a medium size aand weight. 3. The tip material, for a beginner, should be wood - usually the same type as the rest of the stick. You can get nylon tipped drumsticks but you dont need to use them unless you are perfecting complex rudiments and I dont recommend them for playing. 4. Tips come in many shapes and different shapes give you very slightly different sounds. For a beginner, the best shape would be the mushroom shape (also known as the tear drop or acorn shape). It probably wont make much difference at all what style tip you have if you are just learning. 5. The length of the drumstick does really matter. If you get used to playing with a small stick, you wont be able to play with a large stick. A beginner should get used to a medium stick. 16/40cm is a good size.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.0 \t\t Your typical drumstick is made of Hickory wood which neither that dense nor that light. Maple is another popular wood for sticks but is lighter than Hickory. Your best bet would be sticks made out of Oak, which is quite denser than Hickory and a lot denser than Maple; I know for sure Pro-Mark produces oak sticks that come in various specs and sizes. The typical length for a stick is right around 16, a longer stick would be around 17. Keep in mind that nylon tip sticks, in comparison to wood tip ones, would sound significantly brighter on the cymbals.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.5 \t\t Nylon tips are good sounding on cymbals, therefore youll want to use it if you do a lot of cymbal sounds. It is also more consistent than of the wooden tips, since wooden tips will sounds bad when it is depreciated. Wooden tips on the other hand sounds better on the toms, thats why many rock and pop drummers prefer it than the nylon tips.\n",
            "#> is midi better than usb?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.6 \t\t older usb midi throughput would lag a little in SOME drivers due to usb sending blocks of data. Now adays, those problems are gone. In addition, some usb midi can cause audio interference (my Yamaha CP-33 suffers from this) so I have to use the midi port and a midi-usb interface to get around that. Very few usb midi setups suffer from this, though. Midi has an opto-isolator in the hardware mix that THIS midi usb setup obviously lacks. In -general-, usb midi is way nicer than midi => midi/usb interface => pc And, of course, if you want to connect two KEYBOARDS together, your only option is midi as usb midi only connects you to a computer (in general) Only way to know for sure is google it (you MAY find out something, but probably wont) then hook em up and TEST. And finding a card thatll do midi i/o would be great, but probably spendy and will only be found with a TON of other audio hardware on it that you may not need.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.2 \t\t Midi is a serial connection over current loop at 31250bps. If you are using anything but the cheapest Midi cables, the connection is ground loop free. When connecting your keyboard with analog connections to an amp or mixer, this can make the difference between clean and disturbed audio. USB has by far the larger bandwidth. However, it is an encapsulation of the Midi protocol into a bus protocol with dedicated host and clients. That means that all your connections will likely have to run through your computer. Again, not much fun if ground loops are a problem, and sometimes you just want to set up things without fiddling with a computer. If you just want to input Midi data into a DAW or notation program or expander software or sequencers on your computer, USB is mighty fine. It might even power your keyboard. For actual audio generation and band usage, the absence of a bare Midi connection can be a nuisance, even given its lacklustre speed. Cheap Midi-to-USB adapters (notorious are the ones with a violin clef printed on them and OEMed by everybody) will garble messages, in particular Sysex messages. Stay away. Old Full Speed USB 1.1 adapters at 12Mbps are still so much faster than the end connections that they are fully sufficient (even when sharing a hub and a USB 1.1 extension line with a DAW controller though not an active audio card), and if you get long-past high-end equipment from reputable companies, chances are that they are quite affordable second hand.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.2 \t\t Midi is nowadays mostly sent through USB. One disadvantage is that you can no longer abuse a line of your multicore stage cable for routing Midi (the current loop of the DIN cables is robust enough for that purpose). Another disadvantage is the reason Midi used the current loop approach with optical isolation in the first place: if the keyboards are connected to analog hardware like mixers, the old Midi connections were safe against introducing ground loops. However, if the keyboard has only Midi output, this is not really much of a consideration.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between a cover and a remix?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.5 \t\t A remix uses source material from an existing, recorded piece of music, which has been re-arranged with technology, changes made to that sound and extra material added. A cover is a new performance of the same piece, usually with some changes to instrumentation, styling and approach. Basically, a remix is the same sound, and a cover is the same song. A different singer, singing the song over exactly the same recording is known as karaoke.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.8 \t\t I think the difference is in the context, methods, tools, and limitations. 1) Cover is often used in a singer/band context, where the artist performs a song from another artist, most commonly associated with pop/rock. Remix is used in a production context, where the reconstruction is made using DAWs, effects, synths, edits, etc, most commonly associated with electronic music. 2) In general, a cover remains similar to the original in many ways. Melodies, structure, harmony, lyrics, etc, most elements will remain the same. If there are any changes, theyll tend to be in the arrangement. A remix, in the other hand, can drastically change the source work: different harmony, structure, add/remove/change lyrics, etc. The remix can hold no resemblance to the original, while the cover tends to try to resemble the original. 3) The remix uses material from the original (recordings, sequences, synth patches, etc). The cover doesnt (or tends not to). 4) Because of the above, generally, a cover implies performance and can be done without sound edit tools. A remix implies sound edit tools, and can be done without performers. 5) Theres also difference in how the work is presented. Cover performers tend to replace the original author in the works presentation: Morris Albert - Feelings, The Offspring - Feelings. Remix authors tend to present the work with the original and remix authors included, separately: Nathan Fake - The Sky was Pink, Nathan Fake - The Sky was Pink (James Holden remix). Lets take Corona - The Rhythm of the Night as an example. The cover by Bastille (which is also a mashup) is clearly a cover? No original sample has been used in this one. No original sample can mean different things. No sample from the original track? It doesnt fit the remix description. No original sample as in no originally created sample as in all samples are from the source track, then it fits the remix description. If structurally it resembles the original (harmony, melody, lyrics, rhythm, etc), it is on the cover area. But there are remixes (remakes?) where they only keep the lead singers voice, and everything else is new: Simon from Deep Divas - The Rhythm of the Night. Is this a cover or a remix? And this one actually has remixes of itself too. It depends. How was the structure and harmony changed? Do they try to resemble the original or are they trying to do their own thing? If only the voice is preserved, if really everything else is new as in harmony, melody, key, structure and everything else was changed, then it hardly fits the cover description and is more on the remix grounds. Reinterpretations can be both covers and remixes (and neither), at least as defined by this answer.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.1 \t\t I would say that a cover pertains more to the performance aspect of a song and a remix pertains more to the recording aspect of a song. Using one of the comments by a user in another answer, he asks what about Run DMCs version of Walk This Way. Performance-wise, you could say that Run DMC covered Walk This Way. Recording-wise it was a remix because it used pieces of the original recording by Aerosmith. Another point to make is that a remix incorporates the original recording in a different recorded arrangment. A cover is an actual performance of an existing song (whether recorded or not) by a separate artist.\n",
            "#> what is accented and unaccented beats?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.5 \t\t Know first that these terms do not correspond to whether a note has an accent (>) written. Rather, the definition relates to where the note happens within the measure. An accented note is simply one that happens on the beat, e.g., on beats 1, 2, 3, or 4 in 4/4 time. An unaccented note is one that happens off the beat, e.g., on the & between the on-beats. But tempo is a spectrum. If the music is fast enough and is in more of a cut time, beats 2 and 4 start to transition from on the beat to off the beat. But I would guess that, in an exam situation, they would give a pretty clear example to illustrate the concept. These terms are especially helpful when it comes to labeling non-chord (or non-harmonic) tones. In the below example, the D marked U is an unaccented neighbor tone, whereas the D marked A is an accented passing tone. See also What are the On and Off beats?\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 20.0 \t\t I worry that your quoted source isnt the best; meter is the rhythmic structure of the music is not a very good definition. Here, for instance, is a better and more concise definition: Meter refers to the grouping of accented and unaccented beats into recurring patterns. (Steven Laitzs The Complete Musician) (Other books/authors, like Lerdahl/Jackendoff in A Generative Theory of Tonal Music, Krebs in Fantasy Pieces, and Rothstein in Phrase Rhythm in Tonal Music, have similar (but more long-winded) definitions.) Thus, when we talk about polymeter, were talking about multiple grouping structures. The SE answer you link displays this nicely in its example of polymeter, because there is a 5-grouped structure playing alongside a 4-grouped one, and the downbeats of the grouping structures (that is, the accents) are not aligned. Meanwhile, the accents in the polyrhythmic example are aligned; its just the rhythm that takes place within these accents that differs. When viewed in this way, we see that the word roots were chosen correctly.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 19.8 \t\t Although the terms are used interchangeably, in the strictest, most distinct sense of the word, rhythm is groups of notes of different duration, while meter is the overall feel of a song as far as which beats are accented and unaccented. For instance, a dotted quarter followed by an eighth followed by two sixteenths is a rhythm, but meter has more to do with the time signature. For instance, you might say that a song has a triple or three (ONE-two-three, ONE-two-three) meter, even though there may be subdivision like dotted notes, eighths, sixteenths, or triplets in the actual rhythm of the melody. 6/8, 4/4, 3/4 and such refer to the meter of the song, whereas rhythm refers more to the duration of individual notes or groups of notes in the song. This is how I would differentiate between the two. Hope this helps!\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 23.9 \t\t The Les Paul Junior is not a different size guitar, its simply an entry-level Les Paul model. It was originally designed to be an affordable alternative to the Les Paul Standard, and thus is not as fully-featured. The main differences compared to a traditional Les Paul are: flat top instead of carved top only one pickup, usually a P90 consequently, also only one volume and tone knob wrap-around tailpiece instead of the tune-o-matic bridge and tailpiece in Epiphones case, a bolt-on neck, rather than a set neck You can read more about the Les Paul Junior in the Wikipedia article. Also, you can compare the specs of the Epiphone Les Paul Standard and Les Paul Junior. As far as I can see, they both have the same scale length (629 mm / 24.75) and number of frets (22). If you start with a Les Paul Junior, you shouldnt have any difficulty switching to a higher-end Les Paul model, save perhaps having to adjust to a second pickup and more tonal options at your disposal.\n",

The Les Paul Special was a popular model, so people selling the Junior may mistakenly be adding the word Special to the description, or calling it the Junior Special to indicate what model it is patterned after. If there is a version that you have found that includes the word special on the head stock instead of just Junior Model, it is possible that it is from a short run of the model. Occasionally a manufacturer will put out a short run that is for specific promotional events, or to introduce a special or new component such as a different Humbucker, electronics or finish.\n",

Now, YES--type of wood makes a huge difference in tone! Hell, even different fretboard woods produce noticeably different tones. Problem is, most people that try to compare tonewoods go about it all wrong--they use an amp. Try comparing without plugging in. Yep, now you can hear it.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 22.0 \t\t There are many answers here and some good advice for when other instruments are available. But I feel a need to make an obvious point. All of the suggestions would help you get in the ballpark (close) in the absence of any reference tone. BUT - if you can already get within a half semi-tone by ear - nothing short of a tuning aid or something to generate an accurate reference tone is going to get you any closer than that! I agree that if playing with another instrument (such as an acoustic piano) it is better to tune to that instrument - even if you are a semitone off, than to be in perfect 440 tuning. But I am pretty sure you already know how to tune if there is a piano around. Unfortunately, if you dont have a digital tuner, a pitch pipe, a tuning fork or another instrument that you can tune to, or a smart phone with a tuner ap or tone generator, or a computer, I just dont think you are going to get much closer than within a half semitone. You could leave yourself a voice mail playing your strings when you know they are in tune and listen with ear buds (hey thats at least as good as a tension meter lol), but if you have a phone handy - you can use a tuning ap. If I was on a deserted island with no tuning aids, no phone, no computer, and only had my guitar and I wanted to play to myself - I would be real happy getting within a half semitone of perfect. Nobody else is going to hear me anyway. Hello? Perhaps somebody knows of a reliable way to get more accurate than within a semitone in the absence of a tuning device or anything to generate a reference tone. But I cant think of any. BTW - I am envious of your tone memory (within a half semitone is pretty darn good).\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.9 \t\t I would test the response of your phone microphone with a free app, and against a stand-alone tuner. I play trombone, and I notice when I tune in the lower range, especially at louder volumes, the phone tuning apps tend to jump around a bit. Theyre not necessarily off… at least by much, but its tough to read what theyre trying to tell you. It depends on what you need it for. At the very least, I suspect youll need to place the phone a ways away to avoid that result. I only use my tuning app on my phone for guitar and other higher pitched instruments. Trombone is my primary, so I bought a nice standalone to keep in the case. I realize this isnt the answer youre looking for, but I highly suggest running some tests before spending money on an app.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.8 \t\t Kudos Alan for encouraging your son to play guitar. Good Dad! You can tune your lowest (6th) string to A and tune the rest from there -but I dont recommend this. I do recommend a digital electronic tuner or smart phone tuning ap. But even a short scale guitar should be perfectly capable of staying in tune in standard E A D G B e tuning. You mentioned that you were having trouble keeping the guitar in tune. First thing I would recommend is to be sure you are stretching the new strings properly. I find that even experienced guitar players fail to adequately stretch new strings after install and end up fighting the tuning battle until they have stretched them by playing and constantly re-tuning. When you first install new strings, there is a great deal of slack where the string is not completely tight around the tuning peg. When I change strings, after I get all the strings on and tuned close to pitch, I will start stretching the strings to take out all the slack. Using an electronic tuner, tune each string slightly sharp and then gently tug on the string to stretch it. Its pretty hard to break a string this way but it could happen. Some folks like to stretch them two at a time to reduce the chance of breaking one - but I have never broken a string doing this. I have broken a string by trying to tune the string too high (would probably happen if you try to tune to A). Pull the string away from the fretboard about an inch starting near the body and repeat several times working your way towards the headstock. Then play the string again and you will notice it is now flat. Tighten the tuning key again until slightly sharp and repeat this process until you can no longer get the string to go flat by tugging on it. That string is now fully stretched and should stay in tune. Repeat the process for each of the six strings. You might want to alternate between the bass and treble side while doing this to keep the tension on the neck in balance, but I personally dont worry about this. If that fails to solve the problem, you may need to adjust the intonation and check all the adjustment screws in the bridge. Also, be sure you are using good quality strings. Not sure what brand guitar but hopefully its not an issue of cheap tuning machines. If it is - you can get replacement tuning machines from allparts.com\n",
            "#> is guitar a c instrument?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 26.6 \t\t Ok, lets clear up some confusion. First: The guitar is a transposing instrument. It sounds one octave below written pitch. Second: The guitar is a C instrument. What this means is that the guitarist reads C, they play C, and we all hear C. Regardless of the tuning of the individual strings, this fact still applies. In music, with respect to strings, we dont call it a transposed standard tuning. The fancy word here is scordatura which just basically means alternate tuning. What youre talking about is merely scordatura, which is something that all string players deal with. To be absolutely clear with respect to transposition: If you did have a guitar in Bb, then the guitarist would read a C, would play a C, and we would hear a Bb. Since this is obviously not the case for many styles of music, the guitar therefore is, the large majority of the time, a C-instrument. However, especially in popular styles (rock & roll, blues, funk), utilizing a capo may cause the guitar to be treated as a transposing instrument (though fairly common, this practice is not a universal standard among musicians). In popular styles, the notation will inform the position of the capo, with the chord-notation indicating the shape of the chord relative to the capo and not the sounding pitch. For example, a 1st-position C-major chord on an open guitar will sound as a C-major chord, but a 1st-position C-major chord on a 3rd-fret capod guitar will sound as an Eb-major chord. That said, it should also be noted that even capo notation only relates to chords and that any individual notes traditionally notated on the treble clef will not be transposed, despite the capo. Further, it should also be noted that in addition to transposition being a non-standard performance practice of guitarists, notation I described in the preceding paragraph (which includes numbered tablature) is also non-standard, with both performance practice and notation usually associated with the lay musician (not a concert-trained classical guitarist). If anyone here (or elsewhere) knows of specific, traditionally notated serious concert music wherein both chords and individual notes are notated for a transposing guitar, please add the resource in the comments. Many thanks to Todd Wilcox for the suggestion.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.8 \t\t In well-tempered tuning, a c is a c and an e is an e and a g is a g, regardless of what key youre playing in. So, guitar (normally) being restricted to well-tempered tuning, there is no way a C major chord could be intrinsically any different in different keys. Of course there are different voicings in which you can play the chord, the most common being (in tabulature) e│────0───3───3───8───8───12── b│────1───1───5───5───8───13── g│────0───0───5───5───9───12── d│────2───2───5───5───10──10── A│────3───3───3───7───10──x─── E│────x───x───x───8───8───x─── but the choice among these mostly has to do with sound and playing comfort, not with a songs key. This doesnt hold for all tunings, but as far as guitar and common western music is concerned you shouldnt ever need to worry about that.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.2 \t\t Heres the key sentence: This device allows a large variety of instruments to be tuned: woodwinds, brass, stringed instruments, etc. That is, it allows instruments that are not concert pitch to be tuned in their native key.

BPM stands for beats per minute; its the musical equivalent of miles per hour, and it is the standard way of measuring the tempo of a composition. But the tempo is different from how many notes are played. A piece with a very fast tempo could use relatively few notes, whereas a very slow piece could use many many notes. To go back to the miles per hour analogy, imagine driving 60 miles an hour but only passing two trees. Now imagine driving 1 mile an hour and passing 100 trees. Which is the best measurement of speed, miles per hour or trees per hour? This is why its more common to measure the BPM of a piece instead of the number of notes per minute.\n",

It isnt the right way but rather a right way of measuring tempo. BPM stands for beats per minute. However, you cant measure the speed of a piece by number of notes in a minute. A note is a single pitch, and it can be held for as long (or as short) as denoted by the composer. Because not all notes are held for the same amount of time, you cant measure tempo with the number of notes in a minute (or the number of notes in any period of time). In the song you linked, the notes sound very fast because their values are very short, and also at a pretty fast tempo.\n",

            "#> is whammy bar bad for guitar?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.0 \t\t A key issue in using the whammy bar occurs when strings become slack and therefore change position in the nut. When the whammy bar is returned to neutral, friction at the nut can prevent the strings from returning to their original, natural state, and this can be a large cause of tuning issues. It is therefore important that the strings can move freely through their Vs in the nut. There are two key things you can do to help this: Rubbing graphite, e.g. lead from a very soft pencil, into the V in the nut can help reduce the friction. Ensure the Vs are not too narrow for the strings (causing them to become trapped). This is particularly for the wound strings. If they seem to be gripping the strings too much, you could try widening the slots with a small file (caution—at your own risk!) or taking the guitar to a guitar shop for a professional job.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.7 \t\t Without understanding the background of the question more, I can only give limited answer. If you are wondering what happens to other string if you change the fat E string to F, it really depends on the type of guitar. If the guitar is an electric guitar with tension controlling lever, whammy bar, it will affect other strings. If it is a fixed bridge block - E to F on one string is not going to affect other strings much. Acoustic and Classical guitars will be the same as fixed bridge guitar - other strings will be fine.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.4 \t\t Some Strat. guitars have a small spring which is there to put tension on the bar itself - which is often quite loose in the thread. O.k., some players like it to swing down, but the point is that when the bar itself is unscrewed, there is a liklihood of the spring being lost. One Strat player I work with unscrews the bar, and screws in a small bolt with the same thread design. The other issue, in my eyes, is that the material itself is quite soft, and constant screwing and unscrewing makes an often already floppy bar even worse. It also depends on the sort of case.You say gigbag - which I stopped using about 50 yrs ago when it fell over with a guitar inside, and the head snapped off. Not a lot of protection, apart from rain! Gigbags are often flimsy, and the material can catch or be caught by protrusions like whammy bars, so probably best without.\n",

I know for some lefties it just simply becomes impossible but if you can in any way manage play the conventional way round. There is real benefits for actual left handed players in doing this as your smart hand becomes the picking hand which requires a fair amount more dexterity than the one holding the strings down.

            "\t [2] \t\t 26.7 \t\t Its a matter of experimentation. Some left-handers play right-handed. Some left-handers play a right-handed guitar, but hold it with the neck to the right, so the bass string is nearest the floor. They learn the chord shapes up-side-down. As youve already observed, this is handy for picking up someone elses guitar and jamming. Some left-handers play left-handed guitars. Some right-handers play left-handed guitars. Paul McCartney is a famous example; he is right-handed for most tasks, but he struggled with the guitar until someone suggested he try a left-handed one. I suppose the easiest way to find out is to watch how he instinctively holds a guitar. To avoid spending money on a lefty guitar, you could try him out on a right-handed guitar restrung with the strings the other way around. If it turns out to be more than a temporary experiment, youd want to have the guitar set up for that configuration (adjustments to the nut and the bridge), and of course if theres a scratch plate or a cutaway, those would be in the wrong place -- and when that becomes an irritation, its time to invest in a left-handed guitar.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 26.4 \t\t Tony Iommi is a left-handed person who plays guitar left-handed. Mark Knopfler is a left-handed person who plays guitar right-handed. Eric Gales is a right-handed person who plays guitar left-handed. So, whatever way you choose to proceed, there are great players who blazed that trail. I would not discourage you from trying left-handed. Easiest way is to simply flip the guitar over; thats what Jimi and Elizabeth Cotton did. Try that and see if that works better for you. But be aware that youre learning a skill. Riding a bike was likely unfamiliar to you and you lost your balance a lot before you got it. Guitar is not nearly as extreme, but if it doesnt feel right immediately, youre in good company.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 23.4 \t\t Musical notes that approximate/imitate speech... could be categorized as musical onomatopoeia -- music which imitates sounds of the environment including speech. However, based on your example of Hot Blooded, I think that you are instead looking to describe musical notes that outline a sung melody. If so, I think that the best term for this is simply lyrical melody.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.3 \t\t You can answer this easily by asking simply, What is the difference between a note and a rest? One is sound; the other is silence. note = sound rest = silence Therefore, whereas you will hear an equal length of sound followed by an equal length of silence with a quarter note and a quarter rest, you will hear a full length of sound in a half note. You should be aware that while we may see this and understand this instruction, it may not always sound this way in practice, ironically enough. Certain percussion instruments, for instance, may be struck at regular intervals, but whether they are notated as half notes, or quarter notes plus quarter rests, is, for all intents and purposes, practically indistinguishable by ear.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.2 \t\t The simple answer is that the altered version of a note is considered a different note than the unaltered version. In other words, yes, a C and C# are considered two different notes. To be clear though, the term note actually has three distinct, albeit related meanings in music. First, the term note can be synonymous with pitch, which appears to be how you are using the word. For instance, if I sing an A and you sing an A then we are singing the same note. Note can also be used to mean a certain isolated occurance of a pitch, rather than the pitch itself. In this sense, you could say that the first three notes of the theme from the first movement of Beethovens fifth symphony are the same pitch (G). Lastly, the term can be used to describe the written notation of a pitch and duration, the actual notes on a page of sheet music. Assuming you are asking with the first definition in mind, there is actually one more layer of ambiguity. With the examples you mentioned, it is clear that C and C# are two different pitches (they sound at different frequencies). However, most musicians will tell you that C# and Db are two different notes as well, despite the fact that they represent the same pitch (in equal temperment) are are played with the same key on the piano. And then theres also the question of whether or not you are going to say two pitches separated by an octave (two C#s for instance) are the same or different notes. The point is that the term note is not a particularly well-defined musical term, which makes your seemingly simple question at lot more complicated than you would think. That said, there is no common definition for which C and C# would ever be considered the same note.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 25.4 \t\t How many octaves are there in the human range of hearing? From http://www.penguinproducer.com/Blog/2011/09/did-you-know-octave-frequency-facts/: The human ear can hear a maximum of 10 octaves: 20-40Hz, 40-80 Hz, 80-160 Hz, 160-320 Hz, 320-640 Hz, 640 Hz to 1.28 KHz, 1.28-2.56 KHz, 2.56-5.12 KHz, 5.12-10.24 KHz, and 10.24 KHz up to the upper edge of the human ability to hear. The next octave would start at 20.48 KHz, which is barely above the high threshold of human hearing. Will the same note through all the octaves harmonize? To an extent, but you have to be careful. The ear doesnt respond in the same way through the whole range, and typically, neither do instruments. For example, the notes at the bottom of the piano can sound very muddy when playing chords, due to note inharmonicity and the weak fundamentals of the instrument.\n",

Sonically an octave is absolutely based on frequencies. A “concert A has a frequency of 440Hz and the next A (I.e. the octave) has a frequency of 880Hz and the next octave has a frequency of 1,760Hz. Given the frequency of any note the octave will be double or halve the frequency of the tonic and a pitch that is 12 half steps away from the tonic.\n",

To say that a piece is in the Key of A, would mean that usually most of the notes in the piece would follow the tonal rules of the A Major scale. In Indian music there are two styles that I am aware of, Carnatic and Hindustani. I have forgotten which is which, but in one of them the scale is set in unique ways for each piece where a unique scale is associated with a single raga. This is a different approach than the western tradition where (by comparison) there is a limited set of predefined scales that are used in almost every piece.\n",

However, in a Minor scale its 3 semitones from root to third and then 4 more to the fifth.

The relationship of the tonic to the other notes. There are many such sets of relationships, but two have the distinction of being called keys: major and minor.

            "\t [2] \t\t 24.5 \t\t You determination that keys and scales are not the same is correct. They are not the same but in general - most scales are based on a particular key. Let me try to explain keys and scales in simple terms without getting into a great deal of music theory. Keys determine the group of notes that the composer has to choose from when composing the music. In Western Music there are twelve notes that exist between octaves. They are A (A#/Bb) B C (C#/Db) D (D#/Eb) E F (F#/Gb) G (G#/Ab). The letters in the parenthesis are the same note in practical application because they are played by the same key on piano or same string/fret combination on guitar and in the same place on all instruments that have a fixed tuning system. So there are keys on the piano which would play a note which would be referred to as either an A sharp (A#) or B flat (Bb) - depending on which key you are in. Of the twelve notes, only seven exist in each key. A key can be major or minor. The key signature tells which notes on the musical staff are to be considered (and played) sharp or flat. The key of C major has no sharps or flats thus the key signature shows no sharps or flats. The seven notes in the key of C major are C D E F G A and B. A scale is an ascending series of notes (each one higher than the preceding note) that span an octave. Scales are typically based on a key. So the C major scale would consist of the the notes C D E F G A and B. So to play a C major scale on an instrument, you would start on C and play C D E F G A and B and end the scale by playing C one octave higher. The following types of scales contain 7 notes each: Major, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor, and Melodic Minor. The pattern of intervals between notes (either whole or half step/semitone) is what determines the type scale. These seven note scales are called diatonic scales. In a major diatonic (7 note) scale the pattern of intervals is whole whole half whole whole whole half. Whole is two semitones and half is one. So there is one full (whole) step between the first two notes of a diatonic major scale and one full step between the 2nd and 3rd notes but only a half step between the 3rd and 4th notes. In a natural minor scale the intervals are whole half whole whole half whole whole. Scales can also consist of 5 notes. 5 note scales are known as pentatonic scales and also span an octave. But to span an octave with only 5 notes, larger steps or gaps between notes are required. Just as with diatonic scales, there are different types of pentatonic scales (ie major and minor) and again the pattern of intervals between notes is determined by the type scale (or you could say the pattern is what determines the scale type). Other variations of scales can be invented by the musician to add a particular flavor to their music. In summary, scales are played in ascending note order and are usually based on a particular key (with the exception of the chromatic scale which is all twelve possible notes played in ascending order). The key determines which notes are available to choose from for a particular scale. In general, scales will contain notes derived from the key it is based on. So a major diatonic scale will contain the same notes as the key it is derived from. C major scale shown above contains all the notes in the key of C major - played in ascending order. A major pentatonic scale would also use notes from within the key it is derived from - but only 5 of the seven notes would be used. Think of a scale as climbing or scaling a ladder. The key and type of scale determines how far apart the steps on the ladder are from one another. Pentatonic, or diatonic determined how many steps on the ladder. Each ladder is the same height (an octave) but the spacing for a 5 step ladder is going to be different that for a 7 step ladder. Hope that helps.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 26.4 \t\t A pulse is the heartbeat of the rhythm/music that you hear - and feel - when listening to music and this is what people usually tap along to when listening. The beat is the repeated note value of the time signature. They can often (and are usually) the same thing, or at least they cross over. However I shall give some examples: In a piece with time sig 4/4, the beat is 4 crotchet beats every bar. The pulse is most likely also going to be this however if some notes are more pronounced you may tap your foot 2 beats/bar. In a piece with time sig 6/8, the beat is 6 quaver beats/bar whereas the pulse is usually 2 beats/notes at intervals of dotted crotchets. It will be felt as: 1-and-a-2-and-a, 1-and-a-2-and-a, etc. where 1 is where you tap your foot, the pulse.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.3 \t\t Pragmatically: the Beat is mostly for writing purposes. Pulse is often used synonymously with beat and if I start clapping a pulse, or beat, you wouldnt know if its a quarter-note or an eighth-note etc. It is a pulse, an undefined beat. It has a tempo but not necessarily the same as the song tempo. We get the song tempo once we decide what the beat is. EXAMPLE: I clap a pulse at 80 BPM. I then decide the song has a double-time feel so the pulse is half notes; quarter notes are 160 BPM, the tempo is 160 BPM. In other words the pulse is the feel of the song. The way you choose to write it gives the value of the beat and the tempo. Pulse has a BPM but it might differ from the beat because of the way you want to write the music notes.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.8 \t\t You are right in saying a beat is the steady pulse that underlies the music. The notes exist within this framework. One note may be several beats long.

It refers to broadly defining aspects shared by musical compositions, most often aspects of the musics instrumentation or its particular use, ethnicity etc. - e.g. popular, rock, punk rock; Latin-American music, samba, tango; jazz, trad jazz, bee-bop, improvisatory jazz; classical, orchestral, symphonic music, symphonic poem; concerto, violin-concerto; music for one performer; piano-music, piano-duet music; dance-music, ballet-music, waltz, nocturne, march; music for voice, opera, choral music, vocal-quartet music, Broadway musical, film-music ETC. ETC. Style refers to characteristic features of how music (of a certain era, or within some particular genre) is played or expected to sound, i.e. its actual musical content - the set of expected musical patterns, mannerisms, expressive devices it conventionally makes use of. Baroque, Classical, denote differing styles that are recognizable by their own characteristic musical idioms. Jazz, while constituting a genre, also qualifies as a style (or group of more specific styles), since it makes use of particular performance idioms and techniques. Sonata similarly denotes both a genre and a particular style that is defined by an expected formal succession of events or architectural plan. Free-style implies a composition is not built on any predetermined architectural plan or incorporates a diversity of arbitrarily chosen stylistic idioms.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.5 \t\t These words are very dependent on the context, and in many cases, they can even be treated as synonyms. Thats one reason why you see them being used interchangeably: in case there is no possible confusion, either word can be used. One way to look at it I am not completely sure if this is the correct way to look at it, but Ive always seen it like this: genre is much more broad than a style. A style can be seen as a subdivision of a genre. For instance, rock music is a genre. Alternative rock, progressive rock and orchestral rock are styles of rock music. This is not completely set in stone though, so dont shoot somebody when they say progressive rock is a music genre. :-) Youll see the terms being used interchangeably quite often, simply because their meanings are so closely related. Another way to look at it: A genre is the word for a categorization, so rock music, progressive rock, etc are all genres. Think of a genre as a label. A style is what you call a specific element of the music. For instance, David Gilmours guitar playing style is melodic with lots of string bends.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.9 \t\t For practical purposes, the two words are mostly interchangeable. Style: sometimes people say style to refer more to the conventions of rhythm, harmony, melody, arrangement and production that might be associated with music of a particular type, from a particular area, or of a particular genre. Because of this you can hear people say things like, I consider myself a contemporary electronic/dance artist, but I draw alot of my inspiration from the funk style of the 80s. Genre: genre has a slightly more taxonomical meaning, in that it usually relates to an attempt to group music into somewhat arbitrary structurally related genres and sub genres. I say arbitrary because music is not science and any system of classifying must be at least partially subjective. For instance, at the highest level you might distinguish between instrumental and vocal music. Or between broad groups such as pop, rock, metal, world, concert/classical, jazz/blues/r&b, funk/motown. Each of these has quite a few sub genres. And there is a great deal of overlap and borrowing going on. There are heavy metal guitar players who play classical violin etudes, for example. But in the event of genre-crossing, the genre classification tends to be made on the basis of the audience its aimed at. Although some metal fans may be open to hearing classical music on electric guitar, this kind of performance of classical repertoire is not often heard in the concert hall and so you might say that the average listener of classical music is somewhat uninterested in hearing this type of interpretation of classical music.\n",

This will add some spice in your guitar playing and will separate you from the others.

Realistically though, I have seen people with all sorts of hands play perfectly well on short scale guitars and large basses, so Im not sure you should worry too much about this. If you do find you have trouble up at the 22nd fret, play more down the other end. If the neck feels too thin, buy a wider necked guitar.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 25.1 \t\t Your big hands are not some imaginary pair of generic big hands. Like any other new guitar purchaser, youre going to have to go try some guitars and find one (or more) that feels right to you. There is no one true answer here. Get out there and put your hands on some guitars. Dont limit yourself to what you think you want or what someone else has told you is good, right, or best. I went shopping for an Epiphone SG and ended up in love with an Ibanez SZ520 - because the neck on the Ibanez felt better than anything else I touched. Go to a guitar store (one that carries real guitars - stay away from Wal-Mart, etc.,) and start trying some. You dont have to know how to play anything. You dont have to impress the salesman or the other people in the store. You just have to trust yourself to know what feels good and what doesnt. If you want to get rigorous about it, bring a small notebook and a pen. When you find a model that feels good, write it down. Then you can ask the salesman (Or, frankly ask Google when you get home - for every incredible guitar salesman out there with a huge font of knowledge, there are 150 kids who know less about guitars than they do about Nintendo.) specifics - fret size, radius, neck shape, etc. Heres the truth: A guitar that feels good will be played more than one that doesnt. Feeling good is more important than sounding good. Sound is malleable. If you want to play rock or blues, you can get a decent approximation of any sound out of almost any guitar. Obviously, you cant play metal with a nylon-string classical, but within reason, you can make a guitar that feels right into a guitar that sounds right. But if playing feels bad, youll never get good enough to care how you sound anyhow.\n",
            "#> what are silk and steel guitar strings?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.5 \t\t Silk and steel strings are made to be used on a steel string acoustic guitar. They no longer use silk but instead use a nylon filament that resembles silk. These strings will not work well on an electric guitar because the windings are usually a bronze alloy which will not respond to magnetic pickups (the way the nickle windings on electric strings do) and the steel core is shielded by the windings and the silk to the extent that they are virtually invisible to the magnets. The wound strings on a set of silk and steel strings have a layer of nylon filament between the metal outer winding and the steel core. The plain steel strings are no different than any other electric or acoustic plain steel strings. See the pictures below to see the difference between silk and steel strings, normal acoustic strings, and normal classical nylon core strings. Silk and steel Normal steel core acoustic string Nylon core classical string The main characteristics of silk and steel are as follows: 1) Because the nylon filament acts as sort of a padding - they have a much softer feel than regular steel string acoustic strings. This makes them easier on the fingers and many guitarist who play fingerstyle using the meat of their fingers instead of fingernails or finger picks prefer the softer feel. The softer feel is also more finger friendly in general for both the picking fingers and the fretting fingers. 2) The sound is much more mellow than normal steel strings due primarily to the damping effect of the silk wrapping. Some players prefer the more mellow sound. 3) They tune up with lower tension than normal steel string wound strings. This is because the wound strings have a thinner steel core to allow room for the silk wrapping between the outer winding and the steel core. The plain steel strings (b and high e) tune to the same tension as any steel string with the same gauge but they tend to be on the lighter side in a set of silk and steel strings. Warning - the tension is still too high for a classical guitar with no truss rod. 4) The lower tension contributes to the softer feel because you dont need to press as hard to get the string to the fret. Because of the lower tension they are easier to bend. Although most folks who use silk and steel strings are playing more classical style music with fingerpicking and dont often bend strings. Also because of the lower tension - they are not well suited for heavy strumming because the string deflection will be greater than higher tension normal steel strings. 5) They are quieter to play because string noise caused by fingers sliding on the strings are muted somewhat by the silk wrapping. This might be an advantage for fingerstyle players and a big advantage for players who use sliding as part of their technique. Silk and Steel strings are ideal for fingerstyle players who prefer to play a steel string guitar and want a mellower sound and softer feel - similar to a nylon string guitar.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.0 \t\t Silk and Steel strings are generally made to have lower tension and a mellower tone than regular steel strings. I dont know if all Silk and Steel strings are made from the same materials, however, or even necessarily contain silk. GHS says its Silk and Steel strings have a silk and steel core wrapped with silver-plated copper wire. According to GHS, this results in a lower-tension string with a mellower tone than the equivalent standard steel string. Martin says its Marquis Silk & Steel Folk strings are made ...with tin-plated steel core wire and silver-plated copper compound wrap wire according to Martin. If you look at the tension chart on the referenced page, youll see that the Folk strings have lower tension than either the 80/20 bronze or the 92/8 Phosphor Bronze strings. Also, just to further confuse the issue of what Silk and Steel means, Martin says; We created our Marquis line to pamper your guitar by adding a soft silk wrap to the ball ends which prevent wear and tear on the bridge and end plate as you play. Our silk wrap puts a comforting layer of protection in place every time you change your strings. I have a set of Marquis Fok Silk & Steel strings on my acoustic. They are very easy playing with a nice mellow tone, but also not very loud and easy to accidentally bend if you use too much pressure.\n",

            "\t [2] \t\t 25.0 \t\t In the British Brass Band Tradition, the Baritone is a member of the Saxhorn family, whereas the Euphonium is a member of the Tuba family. The Euphonium has a wider bore and a more conical flare over more of the instruments length, compared to the smaller, shorter Baritone flare. Generally, most Reasonable Euphoniums in the UK will have 4 Valves, arranged 3 upright and one on the side, whereas Baritones would have 3 Valves, although 4 Valve Baritones are now available and used in some Brass Bands. In standard British Brass Bands, there are 2 Euphoniums and 2 Baritones, usually sitting together and frequently playing the same part. Because of the difference in bore and bell size, the Euphonium tends to have a more mellow sound, although the instruments do blend very effectively in the middle of the Band. Modern Composers are starting to write for the Baritone as a separate instrument, often as a downward extension of the Tenor Horn section. The Euphoniums, likewise, tend to be written as an upward extension of the Tuba (Bass) Section. In British Brass Bands, both instruments are written as Bb instruments in Treble Clef. The old trick (in the UK) for telling the difference between a 3 Valve Baritone and a 3 Valve Euphonium was to take out the main Tuning Slide, turn it round, and try to insert the slide with the legs in the opposite hole. If it fits, its a Baritone. If it doesnt, its a Euphonium. This may not apply in other locations! :-) Dave Werdens Site makes a good reference to differences and similarities between the two instruments and also has pictures of the different British and American Instruments..

            "\t [3] \t\t 23.4 \t\t While not disagreeing with tubadazs great answer, historians often quibble about the origins of various brass horns, and these horns have no shortage of ambiguity over their history. Its no secret that the terms are commonly mixed; a Google Image search for Baritone Horn yields a large number of instruments more correctly called euphoniums. The modern baritone horn is derived from a family of narrowly-conically-bored instruments known as saxhorns. tubadaz says they are cylindrically-bored instruments, but hes technically incorrect on that; theyre just not as conical as a horn, euphonium or tuba (though more so than the trumpet or trombone, which are typically held up as examples of cylindrical bores). They were invented in the early 1830s by Adolphe Sax, also the father of the saxophone. His vision was to replace the menagerie of brass horns, all of varying regional and cultural origin, with one system of instrument design and construction; 3 edge-mounted dual-piston valves, circular piping arrangement, long straight conical bell, played with a circular cup mouthpiece. The resulting instruments could then be switched between more easily by players as the need arose, unlike the differing mouthpieces, valve designs and orientations of other brass families He was modestly successful; the family contains ancestors of the modern cornet (sopranino), flugelhorn (soprano), and mellophone (alto), as well as the alto/tenor horn and baritone horn which have changed very little (the main change being a switch from horizontal orientation with rearward bells, popular in marching bands in the Civil War era, to vertical orientation with upward- or forward-facing bells). The bass saxhorn has fallen into disuse, though elements of its design can be seen in some styles of tuba. The baritone horn falls in a gradient of tone with other instruments of the same general range; its slightly more conically-bored and therefore slightly warmer-sounding than the cylindrically-bored trombone, but brighter and edgier than the Wagner tuba and euphonium. The euphonium has a different design path; the intent, from the beginning, was to create a baritone-range instrument with a warmer, sweeter timbre than that of existing tenor instruments like the trombone and saxhorns, more like the French horn and its contrabass helicon cousin (the predecessor to the modern sousaphone and ultimately the concert tuba). This was accomplished by scaling down and rearranging the helicons circular construction while keeping its wide conical cross-section. Wagner had the same idea after hearing Saxs baritone saxhorn; his creation was the Wagner tuba, achieved by scaling up the French horn Wagner sought to emulate at lower registers. Some euphoniums have three valves, similar to the baritone horn, but the majority nowadays have four, adding the trigger valve from the French horn and double Wagner tuba which lowers the instruments fundamental by a perfect fourth. As the thumb is typically needed to support a euphonium near the valve tree, this fourth valve is usually either a pinky valve similar to modern tubas, or a compensating valve on the side of the instrument, used by the index finger of the non-valve hand. So, the big differences between a true baritone horn and a euphonium are: Baritone horn virtually always has three valves, in standard configuration; modern euphoniums almost always have four, the extra being more or less the same total length as the first and third combined Baritone horn has a narrower bore than the euphonium for most of its length, with the conical expansion becoming most prevalent only at the bell Baritone horn is typically more compactly coiled, with valves exposed over the top of the downtube leading to the bell, while euphoniums typically have their valves placed underneath the topmost section of the main pipe Baritone horn has a more focused, edgy tone than the mellower euphonium Baritone horn is lighter; for this reason its more often given to beginning students to learn on, before graduating to the euphoniums greater weight and extra valve Baritone horns typically cost less due to less material and surface area to be worked during construction (this is a rather broad statement and there is considerable overlap; you can find many examples of euphoniums costing less than baritones if you look, but these are generally not apples to apples comparisons in terms of features and build quality) Baritone horns cannot play their fundamental frequency, which for a Bb instrument is the Bb two leger lines and a space below the bass staff; this is a side effect of the narrower cross section. Euphoniums can play this note without valves; tubas have the same written fundamental note, but like the double bass they sound an octave lower than traditionally scored The similarities: Core range is virtually identical, other than the loss of the fundamental partial on the baritone; they can be used interchangeably for most military band arrangements. Both can be scored on bass or treble clef (historically the tenor clef was also used; this clef is still seen from time to time for trombone but is seldom used for horns). Basic technique, embouchure, breath supply needed, etc are all more or less identical. Again, this makes the baritone horn a good first step for low brass students\n",
            "#> can you use a guitar amp for ukulele?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.5 \t\t Since your uke is solid-body, you need the rest of your setup -- the amp, speaker, cabinet to give character to the sound. Fortunately the ukuleles pitch range is within that of a guitars. A soprano uke is similar to the top strings of a guitar being played high up the fretboard. A baritone uke is similar to the top strings of a guitar being played nearer the nut. So amplifiers designed for an electric guitar will work well with the uke. You might also fancy experimenting with pedals, to get even more distortion, reverb etc. (I would note that the AC/DC sound is from cranking the gain high on the clean channel of an amp with no pedals) A guitar does reach much lower pitches than a uke, so youll never get that gutsy crunch a guitarist gets from power-chording on the bass strings. You can play with EQ to at least make the uke less piercing. Since youre not looking to play in front of a crowd, go small. There are lots of very good small amps around nowadays, such as the tiny Danelectro Honeytone, Roland Microcube, and many others. Theyre not toys either - Ive seen them micd up through the PA at major artists gigs.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 21.8 \t\t Most Uke players want a kind of acoustic sound. Most guitar amps color the sound and make the Uke sound distinctly more electric. I have a Marshall AS50D and it has a separate tweeter, which makes the tone more neutral. It also has an anti-feedback filter. I believe thats pretty much a notch filter that suppresses the band where most feedback occurs. With my standard guitar amp, its a constant war to keep the uke from exploding from feedback. With the Marshall, its no prob. There are plenty of other amps out there (as well as PAs) that fill the bill nicely. I just provided one example. On the plus side, any of your acoustic instruments that have pickups will sound great through this kind of amp. On the minus side, its more gear to buy and more gear to carry. If youre really keen on playing AC/DC, then why not get a shredder guitar, a cheap used Crate amp, turn everything all the way up and wail away?\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 21.0 \t\t Between guitar and ukulele, I would recommend the ukulele for you to start with. Here is why: Ukulele is easier for a beginner. It has fewer strings, making chord shapes easier. Because it is smaller, it is easier to hold. The nylon strings are easier on your fingers than the steel strings of a guitar. Ukulele is more portable. It is smaller and lighter, and is easier to take with you anywhere you want to go. Ukuleles are less expensive. Because of their smaller size, you can purchase a good ukulele for less than you could a good guitar. Ukulele can prepare you for guitar. If you decide in the future you want to “upgrade to guitar, your time spent with a uke will not be wasted. Chord shapes, strumming rhythms and techniques, and songs are all transferable to the guitar.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between time signatures?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 26.2 \t\t Time signatures can be written in many ways and are largely contextual, so the short answer is no. However, I think it is absolutely possible to come up with synonymous time signatures, based on the phrasing, pulse and beat emphasis. This means you can tell the difference between 3/4 and 6/8 usually. The problem with being accurate here is that while theres a technical difference between time sigs like 6/8 and 12/8, theyre often ignored and the most practical, or just the one the composers familiar with is used. So overall Id say technically no, but in practical terms yes.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.7 \t\t A time signature is simply the composers way of telling you how s/he is subdividing the measure. So in 4/4 time, the composer imagines the measure divided into four beats, while in 8/8 time, the composer imagines the measure divided into eight beats. The difference is less in the strict timing and more in the feel or pulse of the music. Try counting these out loud: 4/4 time: 1-2-3-4-/1-2-3-4- 8/8 time: 12345678/12345678 2/2 time: 1---2---/1---2--- All three of these take up exactly the same amount of time, but to me, the 4/4 time feels steady, while the 8/8 time feels brisk and the 2/2 time feels stately. In all three time signatures, a quarter note will have the same value—one quarter of the measure—but in 4/4 time, it represents the pulse of the music, while in 8/8, its two pulses and in 2/2 time, its half a pulse. A difference in feel between 3/4 and 6/8 time can be even more obvious. In 3/4 time, the measure is broken up into three distinct beats, as in a waltz. In 6/8 time, by contrast, the measure is often broken up into two beats, each with a triplet feel. Like this: 3/4 time: ONE and TWO and TRE and/ONE and TWO and TRE and  6/8 time: ONE two tre FOR fiv six/ONE two tre FOR fiv six  If the composer writes three quarter notes in 3/4 time, it will feel like three notes on the beat. But if the composer writes three quarter notes in 6/8 time, the second note may feel syncopated relative to the overall pulse of the music. Update: Listen to the first twenty seconds or so of La Pistola y El Corazon by Los Lobos. Is it in 3/4 or 6/8 time? Depending on how you hear it, the music has a much different feel, with the lead guitars putting emphasis on different parts of the melody. Listen a few times and try to hear it both ways!\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 25.5 \t\t Everywhere I look, every resource I read, says that time signatures determine the feel and meter of the music. Either these materials are wrong, or youre interpreting them incorrectly. The time signature doesnt determine the meter, the music itself does that. A time signature is a device we use when notating music that makes it easy to see where in the meter each note falls. The composer/engraver should choose the time signature that matches up with the music in the cleanest way. People will insist that certain beats will be stronger with certain time signatures. This is also incorrect. Different genres of music accent beats differently, but we use the same set of time signatures to notate them out of simplicity. Again, time signatures do not determine anything about the music. The first movement of Beethovens Fifth Piano Concerto is common time. Yet the grand piano solo at the beginning is shoved into one measure, regardless of the time signature, and nothing bad seems to happen. What you have here is a cadenza, a portion of the music that is more free-form, and which therefore doesnt fit into our notational systems as well. Turns out its not common time (4/4) but actually cut time (2/2). Whats the difference? Not much. 4/4 vs. 2/2 in particular is a fuzzy distinction for exactly the reasons you listed, and much of the time the choice between them is more about history and convention. Marches are almost always in cut time, for example. Also note that you could always double or halve all of the note durations and adjust the bottom of the time signature. For example, take a piece notated in 4/4, cut everything in half (quarters turn into eighths, etc.), and change the time signature to 4/8. Basically the same thing, but less conventional. Musicians would look at it and probably assume that it was supposed to be played very fast, which may or may not be correct. Its also very common in musical theater for the arranger to just write 4/4 (probably because it was the default in their software) when really the music would be better served to be notated in 2/2 because of its speed. And then you get Rachmaninoff, who will do weird things like change the time signature for one measure only. This is because the music is too complicated, and its rhythm changing so much that it doesnt fit neatly into one time signature. These one measure time changes are there to account for a rhythmic hiccup or extension.\n",
            "#> what are guitar scale patterns?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.7 \t\t Patterns of scales (and chords) are movable up and down the neck. You dont have to know where every note is. But you do need to know how to find a note in a scale pattern, which in turn can be played in different parts of the neck, depending on the key of the scale. This is same for every chord pattern. The open chords are just barre chords with no barre (or capo). The guitar is a chordal instrument. So, instead of focusing primarily on scales at first, learn the common open chords. Get to know them enough to play different songs in the most common keys (G, D, C, A, Em, Am) and the most common key (or degree) patterns (I-IV-V; I-vi-IV-V, I-V-vi-IV, etc...). On guitar, the root note is generally the lowest, or bass note of the chord, and is generally what the chord is named. Once you feel comfortable with the open chords and common chord progressions, experiment with moving the same chord and key patterns up and down the neck, either with a capo, or their barre chord equivalent. The neck and fretboard has little dots that you can use as reference points. Use them. The most common guitar root notes fall on those dots (G, C, D, A). The two dots are the 12th fret, which is an octave up from the open, unfretted strings.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.5 \t\t Matt Putnam offered an excellent answer but based on some of the comments a more complete explanation might be helpful for those who still are not sure how scale patterns can be useful for a guitarist. TLDR - skip to summary. The guitar and similar fretted instruments give the player options for multiple places on different strings and frets to play any given tone - unlike a piano which typically can play 88 different tones but has only one place to play each of them (one key per tone). Playing a C major scale on a keyboard is a simple linear exercise where you begin on any of the C keys and play each successive white key to the right until you get to the next C (one octave higher). Similarly, other scales played on keyboard will involve a similar linear pattern (but with some black keys used in place of some white keys). On guitar, there is no easy linear progression where the next note is always to the right of the previous note in the scale unless you play the scale on one string and go from one end of the neck to the other. So playing a scale on guitar sometime means moving a fret or two on the same string or moving to a different string where the next note in the scale might either be to the left or the right. A scale pattern for guitar is a way to play a given scale in an efficient (with minimal distance between notes) manner from a given position on the neck. A scale pattern diagram can be used to show any type of scale (major, minor, modal) (diatonic, minor pentatonic, blues). The good news about playing scales on guitar is that the patterns are the same for each key a scale can be played in. So a particular pattern which can be used to play a C Major scale (pattern two for example) can also be used to play a Major scale in any other key simply by shifting the starting position the new key (use the root positions in the pattern as a guide). So once you learn a particular pattern, you can use it for all the keys for that type scale (major, minor, etc). So for example if you learn pattern 2 as shown in your question for the C Major Scale and want to play a D major scale - you simply move the pattern up by two frets on the neck and play the exact same pattern! On keyboard, even though the pattern is similar in that its linear and left to right (if playing the scale in ascending order) the pattern is different because to play the D Major scale you must skip some white keys and play some black keys. So whereas on keyboard, if you wanted to be able to play a major scale in 12 different keys, you would basically have to learn 12 patterns. With guitar, you can play a major scale in 12 keys by learning only ONE pattern! The reason you might want to learn more than one pattern is so that you can play a given scale at any position on the guitar neck - from near the head-stock to near the body. The other good news is that there are realistically only 5 practical patterns that you need to learn for any given type scale (minor pentatonic, blues, major, etc.) to be able to play almost anywhere on the fret-board. You could come up with a 6th pattern for some scales if you have an extended fretboard and dont mind playing all the way to the end of the neck near the bridge. Learning patterns are useful for improvising or soloing or playing lead guitar riffs or fills during a song. They are also useful for playing melodies by ear if you are so inclined. It is not necessary to learn any patterns if you only want to play chords, rhythm guitar or pre-defined arrangements of songs. But if you want to be able to create your own unique arrangements, knowing some scale patterns would be helpful. If you are improvising over a blues progression and you have learned some of the common patterns for the blues scale, you can find the notes you need that are in the correct key by starting the pattern at the correct position on the fretboard for that key. You can play the scales in several positions if you know 3, 4 or 5 patterns - so you can carry your soloing through multiple octaves and make it more interesting. To summarize - the purpose of a scale pattern is to show some practical ways that a particular type scale can be played on the guitar fret-board at different positions on the neck. The reason to learn the patterns is that they repeat for each possible key that a particular type scale can be played in. Patterns are particularly useful when composing or soloing because they allow you to know where the correct notes are for the key or scale you want to compose or improvise in. EDIT: To clear up some potential confusion, a scale is played from root through the root at the next octave. The Scale Patterns shown in the answer are carried past the root to root actual scale to show where the notes were if you continued the scale past the octave which is common during improvising or soloing. Each Scale Pattern shows both the actual scale which is red dot to red dot (the root note of the scale) and the extensions that can be reached from the same position on the guitar neck. So to play the actual scale itself, you would start on the root and play through to the octave of the root both shown in red. Technically if asked to play a C major scale from position 2 shown above - you would begin on the 3rd fret of the A string (red dot) not on the E (6th) string - and end on the 5th fret of the G string (red dot). But while improvising from that position, you would have the option of playing the extended notes on the 6th string or the 1st or 2nd string. The Scale Patterns are usually extended in this manner (past the beginning and end of the scale itself) to show all the notes of the scale that are reachable from a given position.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.4 \t\t The are scale shapes. The help to memorize notes on fretboard. The every scale has multiple positions. The most popular are vertical patterns but there are others This is very popular minor pentatonic scale shape diagram It will be never so easy to play them as it was on keyboard but you will get used to it. The most beneficial thing you can do on guitar is to shift everything chromatically up or down by just moving the shape.

            "\t [1] \t\t 23.7 \t\t The 2 is a fingering notation; the 3 is over the middle and in a different font and size, so I can tell that the 3 is the indication to play a triplet (and the measure only adds up for a triplet). So that 3 doesnt necessarily mean to finger the first A with the 3rd finger, though you may wish to. The notation means: Play the F♯ with your 2nd finger Play those three eighth notes as eighth note triplets (This is not super clear upon viewing. Good question!)\n",

Fingering is usually very subjective, as everyones physiology is different. Whats there is a suggestion, but if if doesnt work for you, experiment to find alternatives. Concert pianists will do this all the time.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.8 \t\t The 2 is a fingering indication. The 3 (which is in italics and a larger font) is indicating that the three notes are a triplet - so the first three notes take one beat. Hope that helps.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between mono stereo and surround sound?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 22.4 \t\t The difference is in the number of channels (signals) used. Mono uses one, stereo uses more than one. In monaural sound one single channel is used. It can be reproduced through several speakers, but all speakers are still reproducing the same copy of the signal. In stereophonic sound more channels are used (typically two). You can use two different channels and make one feed one speaker and the second channel feed a second speaker (which is the most common stereo setup). This is used to create directionality, perspective, space. Here is an example using a two speaker setup. Mono Stereo More technically, true stereo means sound recording and sound reproduction that uses stereographic projection to encode the relative positions of objects and events recorded. In a common stereo setup of two channels: left and right, one channel is sent to the left speaker and the other channel is sent to the right speaker. Now, by controlling to which channel you send the signal you can control the position of the sound. Youll hear sounds coming from different directions depending on which speaker you send the signal to, or in which proportion (you can send just a little more to the right speaker, so the sound is positioned just a little bit to the right). Sounds with equal proportions on both speakers will appear to come from the center. In other words, stereo opens the possibility of playing with sound localization.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.0 \t\t Since we have two ears, on opposite sides of our head, we hear a particular sound from two directions.Each takes a slightly different time to arrive, so we have a good idea where the sound is coming from.To record this stereo sound, two mics(at least) are used.Actually, the best theoretical position for these two mics is at 180 degrees away from each other - just like our ears. In a situation where, say, a band is playing, sound will come from lots of different directions, so several mics can be used, and the position in the mix - pan- can be moved using the recording desk. When you listen to something in stereo with headphones, you can imagine where the guitarist is playing, inside your head.Often, the vocals are dead centre. Obviously, the effect is similar using speakers, but its easier to appreciate where things are in a mix using cans. With mono, there is no spaciality. The sound in each ear is identical. It can be recorded with just one mic. The concept came about when someone listened to recordings that were done with the mic in different places, and he realised that two mics would hear two different mixes. The best way to check if a recording is stereo is to hear applause. Its very obvious whether its mono or not. Surround sound takes this idea further. Basically it used a delay to make the sound appear to come from farther away, but with 7 points now, its achieved using 7 different positions for the mics, which are amplified with 7 different amps and speakers, spread round the room.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 20.7 \t\t The most basic definition of mono or stereo is simply that with stereo you receive information in one ear that is somewhat different to information received by the other. With mono audio your ears are receiving 100% of the same information. Early stereo pop singles are quite interestingly and idiosyncratically mixed. For example King Midas in Reverse by the Hollies has the vocals on the intro mixed 100% in the right channel. If you isolate the left channel you can hear a pleasant instrumental version of the same track. Early producers working in stereo often placed the bass and drums, often relegated to a single track on a 4-track tape, to one channel. I Feel Free by Cream has the roar of the band placed in one channel, and the vocals and tambourine overdubs placed in the other. By the end of the 60s it was more commonplace to place the drums and bass in the centre of the mix and then subtly pan the vocals, and less subtly pan the guitars, keyboards and other instruments, in a bid to reproduce the spatial layout of a band onstage. While mono is sometimes seen as the poor cousin of stereo, producers such as Joe Meek were able to commit powerful and lucid mixes to tape in mono. There are some stereo recordings that pretty much require some form of electronic analysis to demonstrate that they are stereo. Classical performances captured by overhead microphones, no more than a couple of feet apart suspended over an orchestra the width of a concert stage, dont tend to have lively stereo mixes. The two microphones will pick up their subtly different locations with regards to certain instruments, but the effect isnt to produce a jarring or vivid stereo image. Having said that again some early stereo classical records were produced so that sparring instruments were placed at opposite sides of the stereo image. Finally, if OP isnt hearing any difference between switching from mono to stereo then he could be experiencing a hardware issue somewhere, and legitimately isnt being presented with different audio upon making the switch. Speaking personally, the rather desultory soundcard in my laptop isnt capable of recording incoming audio in stereo, but recording software doesnt know this and will happily record the same incoming audio to two separate audio tracks. I would be surprised if a soundcard could only output mono audio, but a cursory Google reveals people reporting this exact problem.\n",
            "#> what is the difference between pulse and beat?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.1 \t\t A pulse is the heartbeat of the rhythm/music that you hear - and feel - when listening to music and this is what people usually tap along to when listening. The beat is the repeated note value of the time signature. They can often (and are usually) the same thing, or at least they cross over. However I shall give some examples: In a piece with time sig 4/4, the beat is 4 crotchet beats every bar. The pulse is most likely also going to be this however if some notes are more pronounced you may tap your foot 2 beats/bar. In a piece with time sig 6/8, the beat is 6 quaver beats/bar whereas the pulse is usually 2 beats/notes at intervals of dotted crotchets. It will be felt as: 1-and-a-2-and-a, 1-and-a-2-and-a, etc. where 1 is where you tap your foot, the pulse.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.0 \t\t Pragmatically: the Beat is mostly for writing purposes. Pulse is often used synonymously with beat and if I start clapping a pulse, or beat, you wouldnt know if its a quarter-note or an eighth-note etc. It is a pulse, an undefined beat. It has a tempo but not necessarily the same as the song tempo. We get the song tempo once we decide what the beat is. EXAMPLE: I clap a pulse at 80 BPM. I then decide the song has a double-time feel so the pulse is half notes; quarter notes are 160 BPM, the tempo is 160 BPM. In other words the pulse is the feel of the song. The way you choose to write it gives the value of the beat and the tempo. Pulse has a BPM but it might differ from the beat because of the way you want to write the music notes.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.1 \t\t You are right in saying a beat is the steady pulse that underlies the music. The notes exist within this framework. One note may be several beats long.

            "\t [1] \t\t 25.5 \t\t I play all 3 instruments. Saxophone is simply an easier instrument than clarinet overall, and is more commonly used in rock music. Its the natural choice. That being said, oboists often find clarinet easier because the embouchure is a bit firmer, which theyre used to. Sax embouchure can feel awkwardly loose, especially on tenor and lower saxes. I know a few excellent soprano/alto/tenor saxophonists who struggle on bari because of the looseness. I come from brass instruments (which actually have a very similar embouchure to oboe), and I share the sentiment. But Id still recommend sax given your goals.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.2 \t\t Assuming the instrument is in good repair, and youre covering the holes properly with your fingers, I think you just have to adjust your playing technique down to clarinet size. Speaking very broadly, you blow a sax harder than a clarinet.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 25.0 \t\t Disclaimer: I do not play saxophone. I, personally, switched to oboe from clarinet, and it was not too bad nor difficult. The firmness of the embouchure for oboe in comparison to the clarinet is somewhat similar, but the clarinet is slightly less firm of an embouchure than oboe. The saxophone embouchure is a lot less firm than the oboes, so there may be some difficulty there. However, fingerings may be more difficult when transitioning to clarinet, as they are generally a lot less similar to oboe than saxophone fingerings. Oboe and saxophone follows the general fingerings for instruments, when clarinet has a different fingering setup than many other instruments. If you want to play jazz though, saxophone is generally more present than clarinet, except for pieces such as One for the Clarinets. In more of an ensemble environment though, you would receive more clarinet solos than saxophone, in my experience. Overall, I would just go with the instrument you like the sound of most and go with that.\n",

Hydration is a huge part of healthy vocal cords, so drink as much water as you can (hot, cold, or otherwise). Its just recommended that if you get thirsty either just before or while singing that you drink room-temperature water. The reason for this is because when muscles get cold they contract. Contracted muscles = tension. Therefore drinking cold water before or while singing causes your vocal cords to tense up and cause a lousy sound.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 23.0 \t\t Drinking cold water might not directly impact your vocal chords, but it can cause a sore throat, which is definitely not going to help your singing: Why does drinking chilled beverages cause sore throat? ...having cold food items can increase your chances of suffering from sore throat. This happens because cold foods cause congestion of the respiratory mucosa. Respiratory mucosa is a protective layer covering the respiratory lining or tissue, which acts as defense mechanism against infections. When this mucosa gets congested (or shrinks) it exposes the respiratory lining to possible infectious agents, making it easier for viruses and bacteria to attack it and cause infections leading to a sore throat. Apart from that, when you drink cold beverages during the summer it is more so capable of leading to an infection. This is because in the summers we tend to drink larger amounts of cold beverages, leading to a constant attack on the respiratory system. These infections also take a while to clear up because most people crave and drink cold drinks even though they are ill, delaying the entire healing process. I lived in a very warm, dry climate for several years and drinking very cold water on a very hot, dry afternoon commonly resulted in a sore throat. It was common knowledge there that doing so was to be avoided. If its very hot, Id think that a sudden change in temperature could also damage the delicate vocal chords.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.9 \t\t I havent found any trustworthy resources about the effect of hot and cold weather on the voice, so I cant comment on that. Humidity of the environment CAN affect the voice, for example the air conditioning in hotels or on airplanes can dry you out significantly, making singing uncomfortable and especially affecting tone (which may be what you mean by texture?) of the voice. Various resources therefore recommend taking a humidifier to environments which would otherwise be uncomfortably dry. The only problem Ive noticed with hot/cold environments is that (a) cold - shivering gets in the way of performance! (b) hot - sweating can make you dehydrated, so you need to drink more water to compensate. On temperature of food/drink: Ice-cold drinks and food (like ice-cream) are considered not helpful for singing, as they make the throat tighten, making it harder to sing. Ive personally found this to affect tone and my higher range. Hot drinks (that dont contain caffeine) may be helpful. Although vocal cords are kept hydrated mostly through drinking plenty of water in order that your whole body is hydrated, organisations such as the British Voice Association also recommend inhaling steam, which can reach the vocal cords. So drinking hot water may provide the dual benefits of hydration and relaxing the vocal cords. I dont know whether this has a directly beneficial effect on tone or range, but I have certainly found it to help stamina when Ive had a lot of singing to do over a short amount of time. I cant find any information about the effect of hot food or very hot drink, so I hope someone else can comment further.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 26.7 \t\t Because it gives a lower, grungier sound. Its the reason that 7 string guitars have become popular with metal bands, you can get that low down chugging :)\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.9 \t\t You have summed it up pretty well. Normally a 7 string guitar will have an extra low B string under the low E. This can be useful for rock and metal because you can add extra low metal tonalities to your power chords without having to tune your whole guitar lower. Im primarily a jazz player and I have always wanted an extra high A string for better soloing range, but for chords the lower B would be more useful. I guess it depends what your main musical role in a band is as to which end you should extend the seventh string on.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.6 \t\t A seven string guitar might have longer scale length to accommodate lower tunings. A six stringed guitar can usually be made to handle B tuning, but there might be intonation issues, especially with Gibson measure, which is 24.75. If one wants to go lower, a longer scale is preferred. That can be another benefit with a seven string guitar. Seven string guitars have different scale lengths, some are normal scale with just an added string. For low tunings with six strings you can look at a baritone guitar. A lot of the modern metal material is performed with a seven string, if you want to play those songs it might be hard with a six string. On the other hand, there are much more good six string guitars than seven string, so there is a trade off with locking oneself to a seven string. I play both kinds, but I tend to prefer six strings these days.\n",

Well, just as its common to use iv in a major key, its common to use IV in a minor one, particularly when its a by-product of a rising melodic minor scale. The function of this whole passage is the rising bass line.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.7 \t\t This progression immediately reminds me of Creep by Radiohead, though it is in C major, not F major. While there is no natural key containing F major and A major, these two chords together are very common in most genres, but especially in rock, which loves minor to major substitutions. D minor is the relative minor of F major, and while the key of D minor natural does not contain an A major, the key of D minor harmonic does. So we have: F major F Bb C D minor Dm Gm Am-->Amaj In the minor key, this substitution v-->V is extremely common in virtually all genres. Rock will also substitute iv-->IV, and occasionally i-->I (though the last one will definitely jar the key from minor to major.) Returning to your question, it is also possible to subsitute major chords with minor chords, though it is less common. The substitution IV-->iv (in the case of F major Bb-->Bbm) is the most common of these. What is nice when we see all these chords together, is that the odd note in A major is C# and the odd note in Bb minor is Db. These two notes are enharmonic, which creates a nice symmetry which I am sure enhances the sound of the progression. To me the IV-->iv in the major scale is the analog of the v-->V in the minor scale. A consequence of adding that one more note to the diatonic in order to obtain the latter substitution, is that we also get the former. It is difficult to pick a genre that regularly substitutes major chords with minor chords. However the practice of borrowing notes from the minor is extremely common in blues melody. The so called blue notes are extra notes, borrowed from the minor, added to the major scale. So in your case in Bb major we get the flat third D-->Db. In fact in blues, you may find yourself playing these notes (Bb major) over chords in Bb major, or even its relative minor (that is G minor, the minor key with the same notes) over chords in G major.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 24.0 \t\t In just intonation there is a real difference between the two, in equal temperament not. For fixed pitch instruments there is no difference, but for other pitched instruments (including vocals) it should make a difference. That does not imply that a performer on a non-fixed pitch instrument will indeed make that difference heard, all the more so when that performer is playing together with fixed pitch instruments.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.0 \t\t Equal temperament, historically, specifically refers to dividing the octave into 12 notes equally. This allows you to play in different keys without sounding too out of tune. Before equal temperament, tuning was based more on how the notes of the scale, and out of the scale, relate to the tonic of the instrument. This is just intonation. So since these two terms refer to specific things in western classical music I would think it would be confusing to use them to describe other tuning systems. So by default, if a scale is not equal temperament it does not mean it is just intonation. If you did want to use these terms you might want to qualify them, like new equal temperament. Or something like that.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.9 \t\t There are two common tuning systems in Western music, which are equal temperament and just-intonation. Just intonation is based around simple frequency ratios, and is therefore more pleasing due to having perfect harmonies. So why wouldnt we use this? It would make sense that if we had a system that supports perfect harmonies, we should use it. Unfortunately, those perfect ratios are centered around one note. So while harmonies may sound more in-tune in one key, they vary wildly and sound borderline unusable in some keys. The advantage of equal-temperament is that compositions can be rewritten and played in any key, and sound relatively unchanged. So while I may not be able to play a piano piece in just-intonation in C#, I can play it in equal temperament and have it sound more in-tune.\n",
            "#> how long does it take to get used to guitar strings?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 23.2 \t\t Playing a couple of hours each day, guitar strings should last longer than 2 weeks. But, light gauge strings may not last as long as heavier strings, and vigorous playing may take a toll on these. Sometimes when strings are replaced, you may not get a full wrap at the string post; this causes extra stress at the point where the string threads into the post, and this can break rather quickly. Or sometimes you may get a kink in the string during installation; this kink will be a weak point that may break sooner. You can extend the life of your strings by wiping them down after every playing session with a clean rag; this will slow the appearance of oxidation on the strings, and keep them sounding more lively longer. If you have enough extra string wrapped around the posts, you can remove the strings and boil them to clean them. You may be able to do this once or twice, and it will make them sound remarkably brighter if they are starting to sound dead. It is a little tedious, but when you need to save money.... Of course, try to avoid kinking the strings each time you install them. Make sure that the strings are seated properly at the saddles, and make sure that you have good wraps at the posts. If you remove old strings and boil them, look for places where the strings are worn; strings with worn wrappings probably need to be replaced.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 22.9 \t\t To me the the final death of the strings comes at the point where they lose their elasticity and the guitar starts going out of tune way too quick.

            "#> what is the difference between a key and a scale?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.7 \t\t A very simplistic way to look at it is this: A scale is a defined set of ordered pitches. A key is the use of a scale in actual music. To say that a piece is in the Key of A, would mean that usually most of the notes in the piece would follow the tonal rules of the A Major scale. In Indian music there are two styles that I am aware of, Carnatic and Hindustani. I have forgotten which is which, but in one of them the scale is set in unique ways for each piece where a unique scale is associated with a single raga. This is a different approach than the western tradition where (by comparison) there is a limited set of predefined scales that are used in almost every piece.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.6 \t\t A key and its scale are very related, so its easy to get confused. A key is defined by two things: The main note. Youll hear it called the center of gravity or tonal center or home note. Its the note to which a melody wants to resolve. The proper name for this note is the tonic. The relationship of the tonic to the other notes. There are many such sets of relationships, but two have the distinction of being called keys: major and minor. (For an in-depth explanation of why keys and modes are not the same, see this question/answer.) Each key has an associated scale and they share the same name. A scale, however, is a specific, ordered collection of notes which begins and ends with the tonic. Its strict and formal. It exhibits the tonic and the other notes in their formal relationships to one another. If a piece of music has harmony, you can identify the key (assuming there is one) by the harmony as well. In this case, there will be a tonic chord, the chord to which the piece resolves. The tonic chord also shares its name with the key and the associated scale. When a piece of music is in a particular key, it isnt restricted to the notes of the associated scale. While you can and should expect the notes of the scale to occur more often than those not in the scale, this is an important distinction that may help you understand the difference. Even if a piece of music strays a bit from the notes of the associated scale, it can remain in the same key so long as the piece still resolves to the tonic note/chord.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 25.5 \t\t A scale or key is a set of notes, or a set of intervals that map to a set of notes. The most direct answer is that a particular scale is simply defined to include some notes and not others. In a Major scale (which you seem to be referencing), its 4 semitones from root to third and then 3 more to the fifth. However, in a Minor scale its 3 semitones from root to third and then 4 more to the fifth. You can easily construct scales to fit whatever number of intervals between scale degrees you would like, such as the 4/8 respectively from the root for the 3rd/5th as you mention. Similarly, there are other musical systems outside of the Western twelve-tone system. None of these are any more objectively valid than any other, though of course there is a lot of theory behind why we tend to prefer some of them. (For example: Whats so special about minor and major scales?) I believe the answers to Why are there twelve notes in an octave? should be very helpful in filling in some of the details, if youre interested in learning more.\n",
            "#> how can you tell the difference between notes with different pitches?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.6 \t\t The simple answer is that the altered version of a note is considered a different note than the unaltered version. In other words, yes, a C and C# are considered two different notes. To be clear though, the term note actually has three distinct, albeit related meanings in music. First, the term note can be synonymous with pitch, which appears to be how you are using the word. For instance, if I sing an A and you sing an A then we are singing the same note. Note can also be used to mean a certain isolated occurance of a pitch, rather than the pitch itself. In this sense, you could say that the first three notes of the theme from the first movement of Beethovens fifth symphony are the same pitch (G). Lastly, the term can be used to describe the written notation of a pitch and duration, the actual notes on a page of sheet music. Assuming you are asking with the first definition in mind, there is actually one more layer of ambiguity. With the examples you mentioned, it is clear that C and C# are two different pitches (they sound at different frequencies). However, most musicians will tell you that C# and Db are two different notes as well, despite the fact that they represent the same pitch (in equal temperment) are are played with the same key on the piano. And then theres also the question of whether or not you are going to say two pitches separated by an octave (two C#s for instance) are the same or different notes. The point is that the term note is not a particularly well-defined musical term, which makes your seemingly simple question at lot more complicated than you would think. That said, there is no common definition for which C and C# would ever be considered the same note.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.2 \t\t Every note has a pitch, determined by the fundamental frequency of the sound wave that produces it. When you have two different notes, you have two different pitches, caused by two different frequencies. The distance between those pitches is called an interval, and corresponds to the ratio of the notes frequencies. For example, if one note is an octave above a second note, their frequencies will have the ratio 2:1. In Just Intonation, which was historically common in Western music at least into the Baroque period, the intervals are determined by forcing the notes to have frequencies that are small whole number ratios to each other. For example, a perfect fifth is 3:2, a perfect forth is 4:3, a major third is 5:4, and a minor third is 6:5. In historical western music, they usually stopped there (the interval 7:6 is not used), and all other intervals are then combinations of these intervals. The benefit of this system is that, because the frequencies are numerically related to one another, they sound very consonant, or pure to the ear. The downside is that those pure intervals only exist in one key; outside of that, the intervals start to break down. For example, if you start at A♭, and go up a major third you get to C (with a ratio of 5:4 = 1.25). If you go up another major third, you reach E (5:4 x 5:4 = 25:16 = 1.5625). If you then go up one more major third, you reach G♯ (5:4 x 5:4 x 5:4 = 125:64 = 1.953125). As you can see, this doesnt quite reach the next highest A♭ (which must have a ratio of 2:1, by definition). The basic mathematical problem is that no matter how many times you repeat any of these ratios (other than the octave), you will never get back to a power of two, which means you will never get back to the starting pitch (in any octave). Which further means that you either have to have an infinite number of notes in your scale, or you have to add in an impure interval somewhere to get back to where you started. If you want to play in lots of different keys and maintain these pure intervals, one possible solution is to use instruments that can freely vary their pitch, like violins or voices, so that you can always adjust to the correct just interval. This is often done subconsciously by singers, even in western music, just by finding what sounds good. However, many instruments cannot do this; especially keyboards and fretted instruments, both of which have to have a predefined scale. One possibility for them is to start adding a bunch of extra notes: Make A♭ and G♯ be two different notes, for example. However, there could be an infinite number of such notes, so things can get pretty insane pretty quickly, like this keyboard that has 24 notes per octave: .\\ This approach hasnt really been pursued much in western music. Instead, the solution that Western music has devised is called 12-Tone Equal Temperament (12-TET). Rather than forcing frequency ratios to pure-sounding whole number ratios, it makes a compromise to divide each octave into twelve equally-sized intervals, and adds them together to get larger intervals. The frequency ratio required for this small interval (which happens to be a half step) is the 12th root of 2 (21/12 = 1.059463...), since multiplying it by itself 12 times gives you back 2 (an octave). In fact, the term ratio is a bit of a misnomer, since this is actually an irrational number. If you combine 7 of these small intervals (27/12 = 1.4983...) you get a close approximation to a pure perfect fifth (3:2 = 1.50). If you combine four of them (24/12 = 1.2599...) you get a less-close approximation to a pure major third (5:4 = 1.250) which is still somewhat serviceable. But the key point is that by making all of the intervals equally out of tune, no key is any worse than the other. You do have to sacrifice the pureness of the intervals, but it is a relatively subtle effect to the untrained ear. Here is a video that demonstrates both types of intervals: TLDR: Just intonation refers to using mathematically simple ratios between a pair pitches; justly tuned intervals are objectively more consonant than non-justly tuned intervals. However, it is mathematically impossible to construct a scale of fixed pitches in which every possible interval is justly tuned, and some may even sound quite bad. 12 TET is one way of compromising when tuning a scale; it equally detunes all intervals, so that no single interval is either perfectly just, nor terribly far away from being just.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.7 \t\t hitting the written notes is different than singing in pitch. In pitch means you are not slightly flat or slightly sharp. This is pretty easy to hear when you have a decent musical ear (ie you are not tone-deaf.) Most of the public can tell when someone is singing on pitch or not, cuz if they arent, it sounds off-key (sour). As for the other thing, whether or not they are singing the correct written notes, you have to take the judges with a grain of salt. Of course they dont know.\n",
            "#> are jumbo frets harder to play?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.0 \t\t A jumbo fret is made with a thicker gauge wire, and consequently the top of the fret is further away from the fretboard. The claimed playing advantages are: you can get your fretting-hand fingers further down in the gap to the side of the string, allowing you to put sideward pressure on the string more easily. In other words : string-bending is easier! (In my experience this is a definite advantage) you can push the string down further before your fingertip starts to touch the fretboard (which then starts to put upward pressure on your finger), so it requires less pressure overall to get the strings down. (In my experience this is not so noticeable) Another advantage is that you can dress the frets one or more times more than with standard frets before having to have them replaced. A possible disadvantage of jumbo frets is that you can unintentionally push the string further out of tune than with standard frets as it can travel further down to the fretboard. The solution is to just not press so hard (see playing advantage no. 2!) In summary : jumbo frets are supposed to be, if anything, easier to play - but you may not notice much difference depending on your technique.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.1 \t\t Here are my thoughts for your situation. You mentioned that you are a beginner and mostly play chords. That leads me to believe that you are not going to be playing much lead or doing full step plus bends. Jumbo frets are popular on many electric guitars and basses. They are rarely seen on acoustic guitar. The main advantage of jumbo frets, is that when playing lead guitar runs, riffs and licks and solos, it is easier to bend the note by pushing the string towards the edge of the neck while fretting. Most frets classified as jumbo are both taller and wider than standard frets. This presents two disadvantages for your style playing. First, the taller frets will make it easy to press down on the string far enough to make the notes you are trying to play - significantly sharp. Whenever I try to play a guitar with jumbo frets, it sounds out of tune because I have not developed the lighter touch needed to play chords and keep from pressing them out of tune. This can happen with standard frets as well - but to a much lesser and barely noticeable degree. The other disadvantage, is that the additional width of the jumbo frets, could eventually lead to less precise intonation. When the frets are new, or re-crowned, they have a crown which in simple terms means they come to a narrower point on top. Ideally, the crown is at the exact distance from the saddle to cause the string fretted at that point to play the intended note. Over time if played often, some of your frets will lose their crown and be flat on top as the friction of steel strings wears out the softer fret wire. With the wider jumbo frets, the flat top is wider and can potentially alter the intonation to a greater degree than narrower standard frets would if similarly worn. This can be corrected by an experienced luthier who takes the time to properly crown the frets with a special file. Its a minimal effect but can mean less accurate intonation. This would not matter so much if you are playing mostly lead and bending the strings because the act of bending alters the note way more than any variance in the intonation caused by worn frets would ever do. For these reasons, if the deciding factor is standard frets verses jumbo frets - and you will be using the guitar to play mostly chords and rhythm as opposed to note bending lead, I would go with the standard frets. Later when you decide to learn to solo and want a guitar that will be easier to bend notes on, add one with jumbo frets to your collection.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.4 \t\t Another factor is the frets on the guitar. Tall jumbo frets have more clearance between the top surface of the fret and the fingerboard. If you press down hard when you fret the string, the pitch might be pulled sharp. Tall frets have been popular on guitars for the last thirty years or so; vintage electric guitars tended to have small frets that are not nearly as tall. Here is a diagram of the different kinds of frets available from Warmoth Custom Guitar Parts. The 6230 and 6130 styles are similar to what was used on the earliest Fender and Gibson electric guitars, respectively. The tall 6150 style is perhaps the most commonly used on guitars made today. Tall frets are favored by shredders and those that bend strings a great deal. If you have a guitar with tall jumbo frets, you can practice using less tension in your fretting fingers so you are not pressing the strings down all the way to the fingerboard. This is beneficial to your technique as well because you will experience less hand fatigue and it might facilitate playing faster. You can also pay an experienced guitar repair technician to file your frets down lower, or to pull out the frets and replace them with smaller frets. This will be expensive. Regardless, you should get a good professional setup on your guitar. This will improve the intonation overall. Heres my recent post about setups. Keep these factors in mind: 1) Try a heavier gauge of strings 2) Learn to fret the strings with less tension in your fingers 3) Fret the strings directly behind each fret. Dont press down with your fingers in the middle of the fingerboard area between two frets. Doing so will mean that you are bending the string down too far and pulling it sharp. 4) If you cant compensate adequately with your fingering technique, you might want to see about getting smaller, lower frets on your guitar 5) If your electric guitar has a tremolo bridge set up to float, you may want to get it set up to lie flat instead. A tremolo bridge set up to float might contribute to unsteady intonation unless you are very careful about your playing technique. 6) In all cases, get a professional setup to improve the intonation of your instrument overall and to set the optimal action for your playing technique.\n",

The fender guitars are more expensive and tend to be of higher quality, whereas Squier guitars are made more cheaply and have lower quality. By this I dont mean that the Squier guitars are low quality and bad, but (usually) they are not so good as a Fender guitar. By good and low quality, I refer mostly to the sound, the playability and the durability of the guitar. A high quality guitar will be able to produce a high quality sound, whereas a low quality guitars sound will not. Similarly, a low quality guitar might not be that easy to play. Using low quality woods might cause pain on your arm, whereas a high quality guitar will have woods that are comfortable for your hands, so you can play for hours without getting any pain. Lastly, a low quality guitar isnt made to last a lifetime.1 The Squier guitars are being made in China and Indonesia, but in the 80s they manufactured them in Japan and they were of pretty good quality. If you look for used squier guitars from the 80s (on Ebay or something) youll see that they are more expensive than some new ones, and that they where made in Japan. The Fender guitars are made in the USA and receive more attention in the production. Some of the guitar parts might be of higher quality (not necessarily all of them), but what makes the quality better is the whole production. You should also look into the Mexican Fender Guitars. They are somewhat above the Squier models and somewhat below the American ones, both pricewise and qualitywise. Again, not every model will be like this. If you have time, you go in depth in this article: Squier vs Fender Stratocaster Guitar Review. It shows many different squier and fender models and it explains whats up with everyone. 1Keep in mind, that a beginner wont easily notice all these differences. Thats why many people start off with these kind of guitars (like me). They are great for someone who doesnt want/cannot spend a lot of money on guitars just yet, so a cheap solution is a good choice in this case.\n",

If we are talking about the functional dominant seventh (G#7, namely G#, B#, D#,F#) replacement, its actually D sharp dim (D#, F#, A, C) with its enharmonic cousin E flat dim (Eb, Gb, Bbb, Dbb).

            "#> are silk and steel strings good?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.9 \t\t Silk and steel strings are made to be used on a steel string acoustic guitar. They no longer use silk but instead use a nylon filament that resembles silk. These strings will not work well on an electric guitar because the windings are usually a bronze alloy which will not respond to magnetic pickups (the way the nickle windings on electric strings do) and the steel core is shielded by the windings and the silk to the extent that they are virtually invisible to the magnets. The wound strings on a set of silk and steel strings have a layer of nylon filament between the metal outer winding and the steel core. The plain steel strings are no different than any other electric or acoustic plain steel strings. See the pictures below to see the difference between silk and steel strings, normal acoustic strings, and normal classical nylon core strings. Silk and steel Normal steel core acoustic string Nylon core classical string The main characteristics of silk and steel are as follows: 1) Because the nylon filament acts as sort of a padding - they have a much softer feel than regular steel string acoustic strings. This makes them easier on the fingers and many guitarist who play fingerstyle using the meat of their fingers instead of fingernails or finger picks prefer the softer feel. The softer feel is also more finger friendly in general for both the picking fingers and the fretting fingers. 2) The sound is much more mellow than normal steel strings due primarily to the damping effect of the silk wrapping. Some players prefer the more mellow sound. 3) They tune up with lower tension than normal steel string wound strings. This is because the wound strings have a thinner steel core to allow room for the silk wrapping between the outer winding and the steel core. The plain steel strings (b and high e) tune to the same tension as any steel string with the same gauge but they tend to be on the lighter side in a set of silk and steel strings. Warning - the tension is still too high for a classical guitar with no truss rod. 4) The lower tension contributes to the softer feel because you dont need to press as hard to get the string to the fret. Because of the lower tension they are easier to bend. Although most folks who use silk and steel strings are playing more classical style music with fingerpicking and dont often bend strings. Also because of the lower tension - they are not well suited for heavy strumming because the string deflection will be greater than higher tension normal steel strings. 5) They are quieter to play because string noise caused by fingers sliding on the strings are muted somewhat by the silk wrapping. This might be an advantage for fingerstyle players and a big advantage for players who use sliding as part of their technique. Silk and Steel strings are ideal for fingerstyle players who prefer to play a steel string guitar and want a mellower sound and softer feel - similar to a nylon string guitar.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.2 \t\t Silk and Steel strings are generally made to have lower tension and a mellower tone than regular steel strings. I dont know if all Silk and Steel strings are made from the same materials, however, or even necessarily contain silk. GHS says its Silk and Steel strings have a silk and steel core wrapped with silver-plated copper wire. According to GHS, this results in a lower-tension string with a mellower tone than the equivalent standard steel string. Martin says its Marquis Silk & Steel Folk strings are made ...with tin-plated steel core wire and silver-plated copper compound wrap wire according to Martin. If you look at the tension chart on the referenced page, youll see that the Folk strings have lower tension than either the 80/20 bronze or the 92/8 Phosphor Bronze strings. Also, just to further confuse the issue of what Silk and Steel means, Martin says; We created our Marquis line to pamper your guitar by adding a soft silk wrap to the ball ends which prevent wear and tear on the bridge and end plate as you play. Our silk wrap puts a comforting layer of protection in place every time you change your strings. I have a set of Marquis Fok Silk & Steel strings on my acoustic. They are very easy playing with a nice mellow tone, but also not very loud and easy to accidentally bend if you use too much pressure.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.4 \t\t Its what you would use on a steel string acoustic guitar to make it sound like a classical/nylon/Spanish (all the same thing) guitar. I used to work at a music store and this is what they were for. They give a mellow sound. You cant use nylon strings on an acoustic guitar made for steel strings because theres not enough tension on the neck once the strings are tuned up. So the silk and steel let you have a nylon string guitar sound on your steel string. Course, they dont sound exactly like a nylon string, but they do pretty good. Also, because they have a steel core, you can hear them with pickups. Hope this helps. Peace.\n",
            "#> are capos bad for guitars?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 25.9 \t\t Capo quality matters, but not for tone. A better capo may give you more even tension on the strings, it may be more convenient to use, or maybe its made of more durable materials or components that can be services or replaced as they wear. The guitars tone will only become affected if the capo throws the strings out of tune differently across the neck, or doesnt hold the strings tightly enough and causes buzzing or muting. Capos can also throw guitars out of tune when used; better capos will do this less than simple ones. (Its worth mentioning that a capo doesnt need to clamp on the strings tightly; it only needs to hold them firmly enough so the strings ring freely. A capo that clamps the strings too tightly will often throw the guitar out of tune.) Capos that use a spring to hold the neck are harder to adjust than one that uses an a mechanism with adjustable tension, but for guitars with a fairly average-sized neck this may not matter. The style of capo that has a stretchy elastic band to clip onto the neck can sometimes work on steel-string guitars but it works very well on classical guitars, that have nylon strings with low tension.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 25.5 \t\t We can concoct reasons why minimal damage might result. But the real-life answer is, no it wont do any harm to the guitar or its strings. And have any of us ever had to replace a 20-year-old capo because of wear?\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.8 \t\t If your guitars intonation is spot-on, the frets are all straight, the neck isnt warped, and the guitar has been strung meticulously, using a good capo that doesnt clamp down on the strings too hard wont throw your guitar out of tune. (See below for more information on specific capos.) However, most guitars arent perfect like this, and the reality is that a capo can throw your tuning off from a little to a lot. The best way to combat this is to learn how to do all these things: String your guitar well so the strings stretch more evenly, and keep your intonation set properly. If your guitar wont allow for this level of adjustment, you may be stuck retuning after putting a capo on and removing it, especially for guitars that arent as well put-together. (Not everyone can afford a $900 Martin!) Whats a good capo? A claw or quick-change style capo (like a Kyser) will throw your strings off more than a capo that you adjust with a thumbscrew to get just the right amount of tension to avoid frets buzzing, but not enough to throw the tuning off. Shubb capos are wonderful for this, and the extra few seconds to get them adjusted is easily negating by saving time on tuning.\n",
            "#> what are extra jumbo frets?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 19.7 \t\t Here are my thoughts for your situation. You mentioned that you are a beginner and mostly play chords. That leads me to believe that you are not going to be playing much lead or doing full step plus bends. Jumbo frets are popular on many electric guitars and basses. They are rarely seen on acoustic guitar. The main advantage of jumbo frets, is that when playing lead guitar runs, riffs and licks and solos, it is easier to bend the note by pushing the string towards the edge of the neck while fretting. Most frets classified as jumbo are both taller and wider than standard frets. This presents two disadvantages for your style playing. First, the taller frets will make it easy to press down on the string far enough to make the notes you are trying to play - significantly sharp. Whenever I try to play a guitar with jumbo frets, it sounds out of tune because I have not developed the lighter touch needed to play chords and keep from pressing them out of tune. This can happen with standard frets as well - but to a much lesser and barely noticeable degree. The other disadvantage, is that the additional width of the jumbo frets, could eventually lead to less precise intonation. When the frets are new, or re-crowned, they have a crown which in simple terms means they come to a narrower point on top. Ideally, the crown is at the exact distance from the saddle to cause the string fretted at that point to play the intended note. Over time if played often, some of your frets will lose their crown and be flat on top as the friction of steel strings wears out the softer fret wire. With the wider jumbo frets, the flat top is wider and can potentially alter the intonation to a greater degree than narrower standard frets would if similarly worn. This can be corrected by an experienced luthier who takes the time to properly crown the frets with a special file. Its a minimal effect but can mean less accurate intonation. This would not matter so much if you are playing mostly lead and bending the strings because the act of bending alters the note way more than any variance in the intonation caused by worn frets would ever do. For these reasons, if the deciding factor is standard frets verses jumbo frets - and you will be using the guitar to play mostly chords and rhythm as opposed to note bending lead, I would go with the standard frets. Later when you decide to learn to solo and want a guitar that will be easier to bend notes on, add one with jumbo frets to your collection.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 18.8 \t\t A jumbo fret is made with a thicker gauge wire, and consequently the top of the fret is further away from the fretboard. The claimed playing advantages are: you can get your fretting-hand fingers further down in the gap to the side of the string, allowing you to put sideward pressure on the string more easily. In other words : string-bending is easier! (In my experience this is a definite advantage) you can push the string down further before your fingertip starts to touch the fretboard (which then starts to put upward pressure on your finger), so it requires less pressure overall to get the strings down. (In my experience this is not so noticeable) Another advantage is that you can dress the frets one or more times more than with standard frets before having to have them replaced. A possible disadvantage of jumbo frets is that you can unintentionally push the string further out of tune than with standard frets as it can travel further down to the fretboard. The solution is to just not press so hard (see playing advantage no. 2!) In summary : jumbo frets are supposed to be, if anything, easier to play - but you may not notice much difference depending on your technique.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 18.5 \t\t Seems to me a vertical drum sander of the right profile would be ideal. Youd want to make a jig to hold your fretboard absolutely square against the drum... Otherwise its going to be very difficult to avoid rocking your work and getting one side deeper than the other. Something I just remembered from reading an article on fretboard scalloping years ago... You can accomplish pretty much the same thing by replacing the stock frets with jumbo or extra-high frets.\n",
            "#> can euphonium play trombone part?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 26.4 \t\t There will be differences in the tone quality, because the baritone/euphonium is a conical bore instrument whereas the trombone is a cylindrical bore. (Generally speaking, this means that the trombone will have a brighter tone than the baritone/euphonium.) But in terms of range, the two instruments are pretty similar, and the baritone can certainly play the trombone part. Furthermore, the two players will typically read the same clefs, assuming theyre from the same background. Just watch out for trombone-specific techniques that a baritone wont be able to play, like a long glissando. And by the way, going the other way could be more difficult. If a baritone part has lots of 16th notes, its probably not wise for a trombone player to attempt to play it (sorry, trombonists...). Edit: As the comments helpfully state, there is a difference between baritone and euphonium, but I think its safe to say OP isnt working with a British brass band.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.5 \t\t The answer to whether to play your solo on trombone or euphonium is one of personal choice. If you want to develop your improvisation skills, trombone might be the better choice since it is a much more common instrument in jazz. You probably wont get invited to many big bands as exclusively a euphonium player. Regarding the question of how to improve your skills, my best piece of advice is to transcribe and learn great solos. Choose solos at your level of proficiency, so for instance, you might start with the first chorus in Miles Davis classic Walkin. Simple F blues that requires very little technique. I just made a video about transcribing where I use a JJ Johnson solo. That particular solo might be challenging for you, but I think youll get some value from the video: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Flfaqkb6yDM Good luck!\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 24.2 \t\t Its certainly common in band music for students and beginners for the euphonium/baritone and trombone parts to be the same; often literally on the same piece of paper with Trombone/Euphonium written in the upper left corner. In more advanced symphonic and brass band music, the instruments are treated independently. This brass band resource says about the euphonium: It is equally at home doubling the solo cornet line an octave down, as a melodic or counter-melodic lead, doubling the Bb bass an octave up or occasionally with the 1st trombone. https://www.bandsman.co.uk/writing.htm So it seems that euphonium/trombone doubling is considered to be an acceptable technique.\n",

            "\t [2] \t\t 24.0 \t\t Modern, large grand pianos still give the best feeling when playing. Upright pianos normally require more force and often dont allow soft notes to be played easily. The quietest note on an upright piano will normally be louder than the quietest note on a grand piano. Therefore, when practising soft pieces or fast, repetitive (Toccata-like) pieces, a grand piano is a great advantage. This is not necessarily because the keys are heavier, but because of fundamental design differences, for example the length of the key. Every key extends into the interior of the piano. The length of the lever part of it is important: The longer, the easier to control the sound. Big grand pianos usually have very long keys and therefore are playable very well. I have a 120 years old upright with a quite peculiar action. After years of practise, I can somehow play softly on it, but I can play softer on a good grand after a minute of practise. However, a good, modern upright might still have a bit better action than a small, very old grand. If Yamaha says that their electric piano tries to mimic a grand piano, then this is a bold promise. On the other side, improving over an average upright should not be too hard for an electric piano. Conclusion: Big grand pianos are the best pianos to play. Your ability to play soft on it will be much better than on a regular upright. A good electric piano might already be better than an average upright.\n",

This is as long as the parts that break are standard things like capacitors etc. I dont see how this is any different to things going wrong on a guitar, like my treble/mid /rhythm switch being a bit temperamental which I really need to take apart and re-solder at some point.\n",

As a beginner, its unlikely that you have the skill and experience to detect the nuance and detail that separates a good digital piano from a great acoustic piano. Pretty much anything made by a reputable brand and marketed as a digital piano (as opposed to a keyboard etc.) will have a keyboard feel thats close enough to a real piano for a beginner. Remember too that real pianos vary dramatically in feel. If you choose a real piano, you should factor in the cost of maintenance. Real pianos need regular tuning; an out-of-tune piano is no pleasure to play, nor to listen to. Digital pianos never go out of tune, and require very little maintenance. In favour of real pianos, theres nothing quite like taking the covers off a real piano, watching the intricate mechanisms, getting the full sound of the uncovered strings, seeing them vibrate, plucking or muting with your hands, etc.\n",

If you want to be as close as possible to the feel of a real piano, youll have to chose wisely and to still invest a good amount of money. The additional features (organ sounds and stuff) are mostly gadgets in that regard. If you can afford the cost, the weight and the sonic disturbance of the real one, theres not much of a discussion here. You will hear everything and its opposite concerning digital pianos: some people claiming to having played acoustic pianos their whole life would say this one is really good while other, of the same background, would say it is a complete steal and would not lay eyes on anything costing less than 2000 dollars. I would say youre good in the $900-$1300 range, and you surely can have a bargain buying second hand. Yamaha is a good pick, but Roland too, in my personal experience. If you know how to play a few chords, the best solution is still to go to a shop and make your own opinion. Digital piano might be as far to real piano as purists claim, but for now the only thing that matters is that it suits you. Youll have all the occasion to be picky in few years, when youre a more experienced player.\n",

For the player, its a piano avatar. This has the advantage that you can switch personalities while staying at the same console. This is conceptually different from something like an electric piano (Fender Rhodes, for example) which have an identity of their own and are not a means to a different end. You compare digital pianos to acoustic pianos, and you compare acoustic pianos to other acoustic pianos. Thats the metric. Good digital pianos may be more expensive than cheap acoustic ones but quite more affordable than those acoustic ones they are supposed to mimic. Is the deal right? It depends on your personal standards and availability of space and money. And whether you want to placate the listener or the player.\n",

In fixed-do, Do is always equivalent to C; Re is always equivalent to D; and so on. Movable Do is used in Britain, Germany, Indian classical music, and the United States. In movable-do, you can pick a different pitch to start on, and sing Do-re-mi-... starting at that note. What you are doing when you do that is singing the major scale in different keys.

Other European countries (Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Russia) will refer to the notes using the Do-Re-Mi pattern rather than C, D, E etc. In the UK & USA, we are more used to learning this naming as children.

A half diminished seventh is denoted with a ø and it is also common to see a ø7 because it is a seventh chord but a half diminished chord will always have a seventh. So you could use Cø or Cø7.

I think its dreadfully unclear if there is no cautionary accidental for the same note in a different octave, and the composer/arranger does not intend that note to be affected by the accidental in another octave, but any cautionary is for clarity only, it is not required according to the rules: “In modern usage a sign is valid for the note that it precedes (but not for the same note in octaves above or below) throughout the rest of the bar, unless expressly contradicted by another sign. (The Oxford Companion to Music, my emphasis) Furthermore and to answer your question: accidentals do not carry through to different staves in a grand staff, so the As of your example would remain natural.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.0 \t\t Accidentals in a key signature always apply to any octave you play in. The human ear hears the same note in neighbouring octaves as almost identical (in fact, many people have a hard time distinguishing them at all). People sing along to a tune in a higher or lower octave with no qualms, and often without noticing. Some instruments, e.g. kettle drums, emit sound that is in fact hard to assign to a particular octave even if you measure it with precision instruments. In brief, it would be majorly unexpected and awkward if an accidental applied only to exactly one particular tone, therefore the rule has always been that it applies to all octaves indifferently. The specific way the accidentals are arranged on the modern five-line system is merely a convention. Its nice to have because it lets experienced players recognize a key at a single glance, but its irrelevant to this principle. In fact, when notated in the bass clef many accidentals go in different places, and that makes no difference either.

            "#> is fret buzz normal on bass?\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 24.9 \t\t Often to avoid fret buzz you need a little bit of relief in the neck, loosening the truss rod in the neck until it curves forward just a little. Whether you need to do this, and how much, depends on other things, especially how low you have your bridge saddles. The higher the saddles, the less relief you need. On a normal (non-bass) guitar, unless the fret finish is really bad, any fret buzz normally comes from the fret one above the one you are fretting. However, on a bass guitar, the string displacement is so much greater that strings can often catch frets further towards the bridge. So to get really clean notes on the bass guitar, you often need an action so high that the instrument isnt as comfortable as it could be to play. In practice, most instruments are set up at a point thats a compromise between the instrument sounding clean, and being easy to play. Another point is that a bit of string clank is often seen as a desirable part of a slightly dirty sound. I have one bass deliberately set up so that the strings occasionally catch the highest frets if I hit the strings hard. This gives a wonderful snarly sound, especially with the bridge pick up. This is something quite cool that you can do on the bass that doesnt work so well on a standard (non-bass) guitar, as it seems to just kill the decay on a standard guitar, and come through the pickups more. In summary, it is totally normal for the unplugged sound of a bass (which, as you say, people dont usually hear) to be quite messy and clangy, and its not necessarily indicative of a problem. However, if you suspect your playing or your sound out of the pickups is being affected, spend some time experimenting with neck relief and saddle height to find whats right for you. (If you are not confident doing neck adjustments, get someone to show you first as it is possible to do damage to the instrument)\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.1 \t\t After gathering more information about your bass through comments I am going to offer some thoughts. It is clear from the description of the problem that for whatever reason, you are getting fret buzz. Fret buzz most commonly results from the vibrating string contacting another fret. Most often this is because the string is too close to the fret it is contacting due to factors discussed below. More rare is a fret that is too high that one or more strings may contact when played. It is common to get more buzz on the lower strings because they have a wider oscillation arc. And you mentioned no buzz on open strings which eliminates most other buzz producing culprits (such as loose hardware). Several things can cause fret buzz. Most common is the action (amount of relief between the strings and fretboard) is too low. But there are several ways to adjust the action. On your bass, you can adjust the truss rod to provide more relief. In most cases a slight bow in the center produces the best results. Completely straight neck or backbow (curved up in the middle) will produce fret buzz in most cases. But there are other adjustments that can impact the action as well. If I am not mistaken, your AriaPro II FB has a bolt on neck. The neck angle can be adjusted (by a guitar tech or luthier). If your neck is angled back too much, it can contribute to fret buzz as well due to lowering the height of strings above fretboard (action). Be sure your neck is set at the the optimal angle. You can also change the action by raising or lowering the bridge. After confirming that the neck angle is correct and adjusting the truss rod to provide a slight bow to counteract the string tension wanting to pull the neck back straight, you can adjust the bridge height to fine tune the action to get the best compromise between playing comfort and buzz free performance. Since your instrument is quite vintage it is possible that the slots in the nut have become worn and the strings could be sitting too close to the frets on the headstock end of the instrument as opposed to the bridge. If the strings get way too close to the frets at the nut end - you might even get some buzzing on your lowest strings when played open. If this is contributing to fret buzz, you can have the nut replaced and properly slotted for the gauge strings you use. Another thing that can cause fret buzz is worn frets. Over time - the strings will wear grooves in the frets and wear them down until so the strings are not as high as they need to be when fretted. Closely examine your frets (particular under the strings) to see if there are any deep grooves or if they appear to be excessively worn. Eventually, if played often enough, almost every guitar or bass that uses metal strings will require a fret job or re-fret. Since there are so many different things that might need adjustment on your bass, I would encourage you to take it to a qualified guitar technician for a full set up and adjustment. I am sure that whatever is causing your fret buzz (and it may be a combination of factors) it can be corrected and your instrument will be fully capable of providing you a very satisfying playing experience. Good luck!\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.6 \t\t Does a properly setup/functioning electric guitar have noticeably more fret buzz than an acoustic? Im not really a guitarist, guitar tech or luthier, so I cant answer your question directly and authoritatively. However, I see that @DavidBowling in comments says that electrics theoretically should not have more fret buzz. What I do know is this, as a bass player: Fret buzz (and other assorted noises, rattles and acoustic/dynamic annoyances) on electrics is much less troublesome than it is on acoustics. The reason is that in many cases the pickups on an electric will not pick up the fret buzz, or the signal from the fret buzz is so weak relative to the signal from the strings that it becomes virtually inaudible by the time the audio signal reaches your speaker, and certainly your ears or those of your audience when at a distance, surrounded by all sorts of sonic noise. It happens often enough that Ill hear some annoying fret buzz or rattling on a bass when playing it unplugged, but through the amp that fret buzz is inaudible, so I dont worry about it if Im pleased with my set-up, even though theres a bit of fret buzz. Any fret buzz that might come through on an electric can also be eliminated or greatly minimized by adjusting the pickup controls or EQ through your amp, pedals, etc. That being so, whether or not its true that there tends to be more fret buzz on electrics, what fret buzz you might encounter is not as much of problem as it might be on an acoustic. That also means that perhaps electric guitar makers, particularly in cheaper models, will produce instruments that are more prone to fret buzz than comparable acoustics, because fret buzz is less of a concern on electrics.\n"

            "\t [1] \t\t 16.6 \t\t I think that computers are incredibly powerful tools for learning, and getting them in the hands of as many children as possible is a good thing. Certainly, supervising your children, especially when they have internet access, is a good idea. My 8yo keeps his netbook on a small work table in my office, so we have our computer time together. I do like that hes mobile -- hes even taken to coming to tech conferences with me (he spoke at one of them) -- and our rules at home are plenty to keep the computer where it belongs.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 15.6 \t\t When they show a clear interest in a deeper understanding of computers. And yes, that can very easily happen at pretty much any age. For some, it may take 3 years. For some, it may take 6 years. For many, it takes 12 years. For most, it never happens. And you should be able to accept that. Computers are really not very interesting to anyone who is not interested in computers. I dont understand what is it about people these days thinking that programming is an essential life skill that must be imposed on every child. It is NOT. Dont ever project your passions onto children. It is a recipe for disaster. If they become curious naturally, then there is certainly nothing wrong with encouraging them, but to shove a child into anything they are not interested in themselves, is simply going to discourage them further down the line. Unlike most artistic and language skills, programming becomes easier to learn as you obtain other relevant abilities and it is not something that takes 20 years to get good at, so there is not a whole lot of motivation behind exposing children uninterested in the field to the pain and suffering of software creation, besides the selfish desires, of course. A bit of a hot take, admittedly, but I have seen this kind of a question one too many times and it always irritates me how eager parents are to decide their childrens careers. There are skills far more universally useful than programming.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 15.2 \t\t Id avoid a laptop mostly because its portability easily translates to droppability/breakability. A desktop is both less expensive and significantly more stable. (Our first kids laptop died by falling out of a bunkbed. It wasnt supposed to be up there, but the child really wanted a comfy pile of pillows to sit on while working, and shed never dropped anything out of bed, and Mom has so many silly rules, and... <crash>) One significant thing to consider, however, is how much technology has changed in a few decades. Back then, there was not much to do with a computer besides learn how to program; games existed, but werent free and immediately downloadable. My 10-year-old prefers to use the computer for playing Minecraft, watching YouTube videos, or playing random web games; these are all purely recreational. (He also uses it for school assignments, but that is not a preferred use!) Almost every child has strong familiarity with computers and the internet, but that has not led to almost every child being deeply interested in programming and technology. Since hes already interested in visual programming with that app, its quite possible to channel that interest. However, choosing good software/languages and providing some level of coaching are just as important as having the computer available. The ease of using a computer as a toy, rather than a tool, could easily reduce its educational utility.\n",
            "\t [4] \t\t 14.8 \t\t I think a laptop is a great gift option. I received my first computer at a young age because I showed a lot of interest in technology. I feel that it benefited me greatly. (I am currently in college for Software Engineering and employed as a Software Developer) Do you have any experience with modern elementary school kids and laptops? All of the middle school and high school students in the middle/high school I attended are given iPads. They are now beginning to provide instruction / apps for basic programming influences. If not a laptop, what’s a good alternative to get him that will let him dig in at more advanced levels? I would highly suggest an older generation refurbished iPad. Depending on what level of laptop, I would guess that an older iPad will be cheaper. There are a range of great apps for coding. My personal favorite is Pythonista (an IDE for Python). Also, depending on what phone the drag and drop app was on, he could also potentially transfer the work he has already done. Another potential benefit is, in my opinion, an iPad is easier to make kid friendly. Of course the need for that depends on the parents.\n",
            "\t [5] \t\t 14.3 \t\t Yes, there are ways to turn a computer into a complete mix, virtual instrument, and signal processing system. Both Apple Mainstage and Ableton Live are used like this by professionals (e.g. NIN and Imogene Heap). Mainstage itself is not very expensive, but everything else about this concept can run you a pretty penny. If you want all the capabilities of Live, that doesnt come cheap. You also have to have an interface that has enough I/O and low enough latency to make it practical, and most of all you need fast hard drives and processors (and a decent bit of RAM) to make it workable. Many acts that have computers doing important tasks on stage will use a rack or three of redundant Mac Pros, so thousands of dollars of computing. But if youve got the money and the time, its absolutely doable.\n",
            "\t [6] \t\t 14.2 \t\t How about building on the skills he has... computers can be creative rather than just passive devices. Why dont you encourage him to learn a programming language like Scratch where he can program games for himself. Alternatively get him a video camera and work on creating some films of his own. These will develop skills that he can enjoy and be creative with. They will also stand him in good stead in later life. You might be amazed by how creative it can be!\n",
            "\t [7] \t\t 14.2 \t\t People generally use computers to make music in two main ways. You can construct a musical collage from pre-packed loops and beats without any musical knowledge (beyond this sounds good!) at all. FL Studio is aimed at this end of the market. I believe the leading producers of a genre called Grime favour FL, and it seems to be making them a great deal of money! Then theres the people who COULD score for an orchestra, play in a rock band, whatever... but use a computer to emulate these expensive and sometimes unavailable resources! They use programs such as Cubase, Sibelius etc. And, of course, theres a whole LOT of people between these two extremes, who trial-and-error their way to a result. Then theres a few people who experiment with composition algorithms, pure computer music. Heres some starter information: http://donyaquick.com/algorithmic-composing-advice/\n",
            "\t [8] \t\t 14.1 \t\t Ive always been the computer geek of my family and it was probably easier in the days when we only had one computer per household (I have three of my own now. And spares!). Ive not been a parent, but from a kids perspective... Engage dont spy. Talk to your kid about what hes doing. Computer programming is a very useful life skill in this day and age. Ask him about what hes coding and what hes doing on the computer. Your kid is probably going to be better at computers than you so its better to find a social solution than a technical one. If you have a single computer (or can have computers in a fixed place) put it in a private but shared space. (Dosent work as well when he has his own.). We could close our door (airconditioner made it necessary anyway), we shared the system, and we had a reasonable amount of privacy over what we did. If you want to put a block - talk to him, and explain why (and see if he has any better ideas). Yeah, hell be able to get around it, but he is already, and its a sign of trust. I for one probably would have understood having filters so I dont accidentally come across content that some may consider inappropriate. While I didnt know it at the time, my parents trusted me. One of my grandmothers (wrongly) suspected I was looking at porn, and my mom defended me. I never heard about it until later. Be supportive (Mine werent and it was a pain) but draw clear lines in terms of time that can be spent on personal projects or general internet lookseeery. Homework needs to be done after all ;). In short? The best way to monitor a teen is not to. If he feels he can talk about these things, he will.\n"

A toy is a substitute for a captured prey, which a cat will typically take home. Carrying his prey, he might be saying: This is mine! and in this case even: And where I take it, that is my home. Another possibility: The kind of meow you are discribing also resembles the sound a cat can make in an unexpected encounter with another cat, not one of the other cats in the house or the yard, but one from outside the territory. Maybe there is the scent of another cat in your new house. The above is based mainly on my personal observations of cats. I am not an educated expert.\n",
            "\t [4] \t\t 14.1 \t\t Your bed is home. When we brought our kitten home, we were instructed to put her in the litter box, and let her explore the house from there. The idea is that she always knows where the litter box is, because thats where her journey started. Whenever something really startled her, she always fled to the litter box. She still fled to the litter box years after we moved (different house, different litter box even). Our latest two cats had the luxury of getting their own bedroom since we had a spare. Although they now live in the house and dont really use that room anymore; they still run there if something has them scared. The same seems to be happening for your cat. He explored both new environments starting from your bed, which means that your bed is his frame of reference (when considering the houses layout). He will have a tendency to default to this place when he is looking for a safe spot. You keep him safe. Due to his medical condition, youve likely been taking care of him for a long time. From your story, I also read that you take personal care of the cat (who needs a lot of care to begin with), which means that hes likely to seek you out if he needs help. Its pretty much the same reason why crying children ask for their mommy, their primary care taker (forgoing gender stereotyping, most children tend to emotionally connect to their mother before connecting to their father). This is somewhat proven by the cat being happy enough to sit on your lap. He doesnt feel safe, which is why hes looking for the safest place (your bed), or someone to keep him safe (you). You mentioned the cat really doesnt take to your absence well (losing weight), which further proves that hes attached to you (in a way that his wellbeing depends on having you near). Your cat is scared and/or feeling alone. At least, thats what I read from his behavior. This can be connected to moving house, although I would expect there to be more of a reason (Ive seen plenty of cats move house without suffering emotional issues). Its possible that his medical situation has left him in a position where he relies on you so much that hes lost the ability to be self-reliant. Was it a sudden change? If your cats behavior changes suddenly, with no provocation (such as moving house), consult a vet. Medical issues can make changes to their behavior, and cats cant tell you where it hurts. From your description, I gather that your cats behavior hasnt changed suddenly (or if it did, that it was related to moving house). So it seems (to me) that hes behaving consistently needy, which doesnt suggest a medical problem. Then again, it doesnt hurt to have a vet confirm that its not medical. What to do? If your cats behavior is indeed learned and not just a consequence from a medical issue, then the only way to get the cat to behave differently is to train him. It seems to me that the cat doesnt trust his new environment. So I would focus on making your cat understand that theres nothing to be afraid of. Theres an old joke that sort of encapsulates how youre supposed to train him: A man walks up to a gas station attendant. Excuse me sir, how much does a drop of fuel cost?. A drop?, the attendant laughs, you can have that for free! The man smiles, reassured. Thank you sir. Please put free drops in my gas tank until its full. Its a stupid joke, but its on-topic for your cat. If your cat is only comfortable at a given distance from your bed, try to make small increments. Depending on how easily he learns ans gets over his fear, these increments could be measured in yard, feed or even inches. Sit on your bed and give him a treat. But with every treat you give, throw it a bit further from the bed, and keep incrementing the distance. Gradually increasing the distance means that he has to move around to get his treats. The key focus here is that you dont force him, because its his choice to go and get the treat or not. Suppose he refuses to go any further than past e.g. your chair. Any treat closer gets eaten, any treat further gets left behind. A - If he stares at the treat, clearly wanting it but being afraid to go there, sweeten the pot by putting multiple treats there. Hes clearly weighing his options, which means that its likely that hell go there if its worth it. If he keeps making progress this way, keep getting him to expand his boundaries by throwing them further and further. Try to always make it his choice rather than your will. B - If he doesnt stare at the treat, or he makes no attempt to want to go there, walk over to the treat yourself, and see if your presence makes him feel safe enough. If this has a notable difference, then you should change tactics compare to A. Clearly, its not the distance from the bed that makes him apprehensive, its the distance from you. Note This doesnt just work for treats. This can be done by placing his food bowl, treats, his toys, ... Your cat seems to be more fearful than average, which means that its going to take a while for him to feel comfortable. But keep working at it, making him expand his boundaries. Even if its inch by inch, thats still progress. Keep reinforcing this behavior. Some other ways: Hide piles of treats in the house. Make sure he doesnt see you put down the treats. The idea that youre trying to convey is that he could have so many treats if he just looks around. Amply reward him when you come home. Bring him something special (e.g. a nice piece of fish). If you always come back with a present for him, he wont mind your absence as much (hell be anticipating the treat). Make him re-evaluate his own decisions. One day (without him seeing it), pull your blanket off your bed and put it on the opposite side of your bedroom. Does he now favor the blanket, or the bed? Regardless of his choice, youre subconsciously getting him to realize that he gets to go wherever he wants to go, he just needs to decide where he wants to go. Once in a while, pull a Hansel & Gretel. When you leave for school/work, leave a trail of treats as you leave. When you come home, youll see how far he managed to get. Its even better if the trail has a small pile of treats once in a while (e.g. behind a corner, so its a surprise). Good luck with teaching him to trust his environment. Its not a quick solution, but as long as he makes the choices (and you dont force him), there shouldnt be any risk of him regressing.\n",

            "\t [5] \t\t 14.3 \t\t I suspect this varies significantly by the person and family. Some advantages to one person will be disadvantages to another. In particular, the differences: Living at home, unless you live on campus already, means a bit of a commute for the child. This means a bit less time for socializing, and less ability to join the kinds of socializing that spontaneously arise. IE, if its a ten or fifteen minute drive, shes less likely to want to go to the party than if its just down the street - and shes less likely to walk by it at random. It also means shell less frequently run into other students and professors walking through the quads/etc. For those so inclined, a major feature of college life is running into others at random and having intellectual discussions about things ineteresting to you. Living at home means less responsibility related to housekeeping and living arrangements. You dont have to worry about rent, you dont have to worry about cleaning, you dont have to worry about food. (Some of those arent concerns anyway in dorms, but often dorm life leads to apartments the third or fourth year.) This is good and bad - you dont learn to have this responsibility, but it also doesnt distract from schoolwork. Living at home means less opportunity for sexual activity, which again is a plus or a minus depending on the person. Even if youre the coolest mom in the world, its still uncomfortable to have sexual partners at home. Continuing in the vein of some good some bad, living at home will also mean she likely will stay more attached to her high school friends and develop fewer new friendships. For someone like me (not very good at making friends), it was hard at first - but also very good for me - to be forced to do so at college. Living at home makes it easier to rely on the crutch of old friendships, but also helps stay closer to those friends, and simplifies social dynamics for someone for whom that might be additional stress. Ultimately, to me it tends to come down mostly to two things: safety net versus more responsibilities, and socialization. Many larger colleges and universities require on-campus living for the first year nowadays; some of that is ensuring they get money for their food program, but also some of it is ensuring students have a chance to learn how to live on their own for a while, and develop social bonds for that first year that help them in college. Living on campus but near home is seen by a lot of people as a good compromise - you can still go home on the weekend most weekends, but you have the during-the-week socialization benefits of living on campus. Of course, for some being kicked out of the nest and forced to figure things out is a necessary thing for their personal development (and so going to a further away college is a good idea), but for others it can add stress thats unnecessary when added to a difficult transition to collegiate academics.\n",
            "\t [6] \t\t 14.0 \t\t In combination with the concept of taking turns you can also talk to your little one about projects. What I mean by that is best illustrated by giving you an example from home first, and they Ill explain how it applies out in the world. The home example is also a way to practice the idea. First, hell need to know to offer help rather than just helping. Youll also want to teach this at home first, and probably already have in some ways. For example, sometimes he might help stir something to help in the kitchen, but he knows you and mommy need to do a lot of the kitchen stuff without his hands getting into it. Projects can work like this too. So in terms of toys; lets say the blocks are out. You go over and start building a particular, house. with the blocks (this also works with play-dough since I know you like it too) When he comes over to help you say, No thanks, I have something particular Im building and Id like to have my own project right now. It was a nice choice to offer though. Why dont you build a project of your own next to me? If he doesnt offer first and just starts building, you can still say, thanks for wanting to help, but Id like to do my own project right now. . . (similar ending to the other). When you are done, tell him all about your house. Who lives in it? Where is each piece of furniture how did you build it... Then let hims share about his house and be amazed with his work too. It is a much more complicated concept than taking turns, and he wont get it right away. However, if you start introducing the idea now at home, then it is one more tool in your arsenal that much sooner. Almost immediately it will make the, nos and the kids that dont want to share seem more normal and less, mean even if he doesnt understand how to operate in the context on his own. When he offers to help a friend at a place like the museum and gets a no, It will just feel like a project situation (which is what it is really). With the stars and other communal toys and situations, you would then help him figure out a domain for his constellations and a domain for the constellations the other boy is working on. You become a team in the creation of your project.

You can syllabify them by using any five-syllable word like university, but methods like that get a little dicey - theyre actually easier to feel than to count.

            "\t [2] \t\t 16.2 \t\t Finger Style I would suggest you practice right-hand patterns. Your note that the exercises you found are useless suggests to me that the area you truly want to improve is your right-hand finger picking technique. There are 3 fundamental patterns you should master with the right hand to begin with: 1) Ascending arpeggio: Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring. 2) Descending arpeggio: Ring, Middle, Index, Thumb 3) Ascending and Descending (played as a sextuplet pattern; 6 notes in a beat). Ring, Middle, Index, Thumb, Index, Middle Now, the best way I know of to practice this pattern is to play a major 7 chord like this: E A G D b e x x 12 11 10 9 (You can play this pattern with all three arpeggio types above). Now, you can get a left-hand work out (and make the exercise more interesting) by stretching one note lower every time, like this: E A G D b e x x 12 11 10 8 E A G D b e x x 12 11 9 8 And continuing until youve stretched all the way back to first position. Let me know if this helps. There are many other exercises that could be useful but I think its a good idea to start here. Pick Style This advice also applies to a pick-style of playing, but in that case the fundamental methods used to play pick-style guitar fall into three categories. Alternate picking Alternate picking is a method of playing that emphasizes a strict rotational picking of down, up, down, up. Chromatic exercises on the guitar with four notes per string are a good way to practice this. The most effective application of alternate picking will be on a single string. the Flight of the Bumblebee is one of the best repertoire pieces to work on alternate picking. Sweep picking Sweep picking is playing several consecutive notes using the same picking direction. By necessity these notes must be on adjacent strings. One of the best ways to practice sweep picking is by playing major and minor triad arpeggios across all strings. Economy picking Economy picking doesnt get as much attention these days, but basically its alternate picking on single strings, but using sweep picking to get across strings. Its very economical, hence the name. One of the best ways to practice economy picking (besides difficult repertoire) is to play three-note scale patterns across the strings, taking care that each time you switch strings you use the same picking motion on the next string as you did on the previous. Its sort of a mini-sweep.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 15.7 \t\t A fuzz pedal, when silicon v. germanium is brought up, almost always refers to a Fuzz Face circuit. This is an extremely simple circuit, with no input buffer, two transistors, a few capacitors and, I think, 5 resistors. Theres also to potentiometers. Silicon v. germanium in this refers to the type of transistors used. Germanium transistors pre-date silicon transistors, and in most respects are completely inferior to silicon. They vary widely in electrical properties, change properties as the temperature changes, leak (meaning current flows when theres no input signal), theyve got low gain and wretched slew rates (how well they change directions to follow the input wave). Theyre totally crappy for computing and high fidelity applications, which is why they are no longer manufactured and have been replaced by silicon. But in fuzz face circuits, they are magic. Germanium FFs have a really nice soft fuzziness to them thats really musical. By contrast, silicon FFs tend to be harsh and buzzy - kind of an ice pick in the forehead type of sound. There are a few models of silicon transistor that have a sufficently low gain to be a better fit in a fuzz face, but still dont sound as good as germanium transistors. However, as germanium transistors of the same model vary like crazy, a FF circuit has to be custom tailored to each pair of transistors used. In addition, the transistors have to be selected to be a good match for each other by measuring the gain of each transistor and pairing them up accordingly. Once the transistors are tested and matched up, the resistor values in the FF circuit need to be adjusted to match the specific gains of the transistors in order to get the best sound out of the stompbox.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 15.1 \t\t A valve (or tube) amp will give you the best tone. Tubes distort differently, and more pleasantly, than transistors do---this has to do with which overtones the distortion emphasizes. While solid-state amps have gotten much better over the years at mimicking tube distortion, theyre still not really there yet. Obviously, you already have an amp you can play around with and see if it sounds okay to your ears. If so, great. But if not, Id recommend a small, class-A tube amp. A vintage Fender Princeton, say, or a Deluxe Reverb would be ideal. If you need a bigger amp, a Bassman combo would be great, or a Vox AC-30 would work well. Peavey makes some pretty nice, reasonably-priced smaller tube amps that would be worth considering as well.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 15.1 \t\t A transposing instrument is one for which the standard practice is to write music in a key different from the sounding pitch of that instrument. For example, a non-transposing instrument is something like a piano (anything with a keyboard, really)--when you read a C on the staff, you play a C and it sounds a concert pitch C. Most pitched percussion instruments fall into this category, as do traditional C transverse flute, oboe, harp, tuba, and most string instruments (like violin, viola, cello). A transposing instrument is one where the player reads a C, plays a C, and what sounds is the name of the key of the instrument. Most instruments are often referred to with the key in their name, for example Bb trumpet, Bb clarinet, Horn in F, Eb alto saxophone, Bb tenor saxophone. There is a third case, where instruments sound an octave displaced from the written notes (to avoid the player having to read too many ledger lines). These arent usually grouped with keyed instruments, but they are technically transposing (for example: crotales, guitar, string bass, piccolo). Players of transposing instruments will have trouble reading music written for other instruments in different keys, unless they are experienced at transposing written music on the fly (regardless of transposition, this is also true for instruments written in different clefs.) The reason for transposing instruments has to do with the fact that many of these instruments come in different sizes that are all playable by someone who knows the technique and fingerings for one of these instruments. There are also historical reasons owing to the fact that brass instruments (before the invention of valves) could only play in the harmonic series native to their current instrument. Anyway, when a saxophone player picks up a saxophone, regardless of whether its keyed in Bb or Eb, the player will use the same fingering for written C on each instrument. The music needs to be transposed into the correct key for this to work, but the result is that the player can play any size saxophone with the same set of fingerings. If the music was not transposed, the player would have to have a different set of fingerings for each saxophone that they played. The above applies as well to the various sizes of clarinet, and the various keys of trumpet. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule left and right--french horn is a particular beast, as professional horn players will see music written in a HUGE range of keys, and be expected to transpose at sight to, typically, an F/Bb double horn.\n",
            "\t [4] \t\t 15.1 \t\t In addition to marks answer: As, mark stated corretly, a guitar amplifier is not interchangeable with a HiFi-ampflifier (like your stereo). Now its important to know whats your budget and what do you want from your sound. You said youre a beginner and so I guess you planned to use a smaller budged and you arent yet obsessed with true valve sound. You can basically divide the amplifier field in 2 sections: tube-amplifier and transistor amplifier. Theyre based on two different kind of circuitries. They have the following basic pros and cons: valve/tube amplifier: pro: warm/rich tone pro: good dynamics con: pricy transistor amplifier: pro: cheap con: less dynamic con: rather cold sound There are also hybrid-amplifiers (called: solid-state) on the market, which are cheaper than tube amps and (generally) better sounding than transistor amps, but on the other hand more expensive than transistor amps and a bit colder sounding than tube-amps. Normal amps are usually quite pricy if you want to have a half-decent one. But there is another alternative: (And its more versatile, which is good for a beginner) A modelling unit! (mark already suggested it) A modelling unit is a more a computer than a normal amplifier. The sounds are emulated versions (usually) of well-known tube- and (in some cases) transistor-amplifiers. They usually have everything you might need built in (tuner, effects and so on), but cheaper models tend to sound cheap. (state the obvious) They come in different packages and price-ranges. Single-units (not sure if thats the right term) are usually good to use with a normal stereo, your headphones, for recording purposes, or even as preamp for a guitar-amplifier. They have NO cabinet, and no power amp! And there are modelling-amplifiers who use a modelling built in a head or combo. There are good and affordable practictice amplifiers. Id recomment you check some of these out: Roland (micro) Cube, Peavy Vypyr, Line6 Spider.\n",
            "\t [5] \t\t 14.7 \t\t Old and new is not the only difference. If these four tubes really must be balanced, you need a tube testing tool for selecting the matching group from much more than just four tubes. However selecting the matching pairs was much more critical for transistor electronics, as individual transistors vary in parameters much more dramatically than tubes. Maybe the pair matching is not required for your amplifier; then replacement of the single failed tube is ok.\n",
            "\t [6] \t\t 14.6 \t\t Actually solid state sounds better!! A JFET has very similar response to a tube(a pentode at least). A tube is actually less perfect than a transistor. BUT THAT IS THE PROBLEM! A tube adds much more distortion to a signal than a transistor(in most designs) BUT it generally(not always) adds a distortion that reinforces the sound. A push pull amplifier generally adds odd order harmonics. Its designed to cancel out even order allowing for more power output. For a single ended class A amp the 2nd harmonic is the strongest(the 5th). These harmonics are much stronger in tubes than solid state but exist in both. It seems that we prefer these colorations as they make the sound more interesting. There are other reasons too: Tubes are generally used with a supply of several hundred volts. This gives a much lower noise floor and hence more headroom. Although this truthfully isnt a huge deal in a properly designed amp. Tubes are much less perfect in design giving many different types of responses for different tubes and even the same tube design. Tube theory has been very well researched and really is what we base our SS theory off of(no coincidence since the physics are abstractly the same). Many many many man hours have been put in getting the best out of tubes. SS is so close to ideal even a poor design can work well. Tubes have a more gradual clipping action when they are overdriven. This actually makes them have less distortion than a SS amp when it is overdriven. Tubes were here first and hence have the psychological factor. Because of all the different variables in a tube(from the resistors and capacitors used to the different types of stages) it has a much wider range of sounds that all might seem subtle but can have a big effect on feel. Feel - tubes have a certain response that feels right when playing guitar. Maybe its psychological maybe not... But it is fact that tubes are less ideal than transistors... for some reason this makes them seem to sound better. No one knows exactly why and many tube amps suck. Also many tube amps suck on low volume(usually class B push pull because of intermodulation distortion) while a SS amp should sound almost the same at all volumes(until it starts clipping). You can take two tube amps, same make and model, and one can sound good and the other bad. This is because the cheap components used and the tolerances can be quite wide. (standard caps have a +-20% difference and resistors from 5% to 10%) So even though they are the same they are not. Some of the new digital modeling amps do quite a nice job at getting very cool distortion and excel at clean sounds(but again, sometimes its too clean and too perfect). Eventually tubes will go away... probably in the next 50 years...\n",
            "\t [7] \t\t 14.5 \t\t Its not just a cultural thing. Theres actually a very simple explanation for it, although it is quite difficult to explain without images, but Ill give it a go. :) The reason is to do with the way that a tube (thermionic valve / vacuum tube / valve) reacts to the signal in a very analogue way, and in a way that the human ear is much more adapted to deal with. As an input signal approaches its maximum level there are a couple of ways the electronics can cope with it. A transistor has a very harsh cutoff of maximum signal. As the amplitude of the signal starts to rise, the highest peaks get cut off at a very specific level, and so you sound wave is effectively squared off. If you can imagine running a sine wave into a transistor amp, and cranking the levels, what youll start to see in the output waveform is the signal tending towards a square wave. If youve ever listened to a pure square wave, youll know it sounds very harsh and mechanical. A valve reacts very differently, though. As the amplitude rises towards the maximum the valve can cope with, the signal is compressed more and more. As a result of the compression of the signal, the hard shoulders of the sound wave are rounded off. The harsh sound of a square wave is a result of these hard shoulders so as they are rounded off, the sound you hear starts to sound less mechanical and more natural to the human ear. Im sorry this description isnt particularly easy to follow, but I couldnt add images that would help to explain it.\n",
            "\t [8] \t\t 13.7 \t\t Well, this is certainly a kind of distortion, but not the kind you get with a fuzz pedal. Fuzz and distortion pedals are characterised by sharp transistor clipping. Rather, the kind of distortion that you hear on old, loud records such as fire comes usually from tube amps that werent originally meant to sound much distorted at all, but were just taken to their limits. When tubes go into saturation, they produce much “softer, subtler clipping, and retain more of the dynamic content (while still compressing the peak range quite a lot – so you can simply get the the bass louder in the mix than possible without compression). Thats not all, though. If you play a dull jazz bass with flatwound strings through a fully-blown Ampeg head, the result wont be so much growl as flatulence. IMO, for a real good growl, you need quite a powerful midrange even in the clean bass signal. I.e. relatively bright strings and powerful playing, so the strings rattle a bit on the fretboard. That also gives some serious treble content, which will otherwise get rather lost in the flood of low-midrange from the overdrive. (It also helps with a particular problem: inharmonicity, which is by nature strong in thick bass strings. With a clean amp, this merely adds a particular character which isnt necessarily bad, but if you later distort it, in particular on soft amp distortion, then the strings harmonics arent quite in line with the artificial harmonics from distortion. That makes the sound pretty muddy. But when the strings rattle on the fretboard, this surpresses inharmonicity in a way similar to how a violin bow does.) The downside to such a “power-pluck sound in itself is that its pretty transient-heavy without a whole lot of tone, and without “enduring strength. That can work out ok for a funky slap bass in a large band context, but in a small rock band youll typically want a bit more body, and thats precisely what the tube overdrive offers. It can also be achieved with compressors, but those dont add the extra growl! As already mentioned, the fingerboard rattling works out differently and, in a sense, more effective on fretless instruments, in particular standup bass. Without frets, you get not such a short, snappy clash when taking the strings space to its limit, but a more levelled crunch – in essence a lower-pitched version of what goes on in a sitar bridge. Depending on the action, this will then work out to the characteristic fretless “mwah, or something quite similar to tube-OD growl. Indeed, the growliest bass sound I know is the one I get from my fretless acoustic bass guitar (bright piëzo pickup, absurdly heavy strings, lots of force required to get decent direct sound), when I then also route it through a tube amp. I used it in this song.\n",
            "Query... buffer, capacitors, circuit\n",
            "\t [1] \t\t 18.6 \t\t The buffer pedal, when used correctly, improves the high frequency response of your overall pedal chain. Everyone knows what it does. Unfortunately, this is totally not the case – most guitarists dont know what a buffer does, and Im afraid both you and Qweevs are among them. A buffer does not boost the treble, and its also not something necessary before any cable longer than 15 ft. Actually, the only reason a buffer makes sense is because the electric guitars arent well-designed. Namely, the pickups have a very high impedance. As a result, the sound is strongly affected if you connect a cable – the longer the cable, the higher its capacitance, and that together with the built-in inductance (a pickup is essentially just an inductor) creates a high-cut effect. The correct way to tackle this problem is to redesign the guitar to offer low output impedance. This is most sensibly done with active circuitry – essentially a buffer built into the guitar. With a (properly implemented) active guitar, you should never need any buffer pedals, unless perhaps youre feeding a kilometre-long cable. Unfortunately, active guitars have never took hold on the market (rather unlike active bass gutars). This is perhaps in some part to blame on the manufacturers not giving the active circuits proper thought. For one thing, if you simply put a buffer right after the pickups, then these will be able to resonate so strongly that the treble range sounds outright annoying – although tastes vary, for example Brian Mays guitar sound makes use of this particular effect. But most pickups actually need a few nanofarads of capacitance to sound good in the usual sense. Just, they cant bear too much load. In particular, If you use really long cables. It depends on the guitar what is too much; try a couple of cables and choose the one that sounds best for your taste. That cable should always go before the buffer, if any. If you drive low-impedance inputs. This includes the microphone/line-level inputs on mixing consoles, but also some guitar effect pedals. Unlike a cable, these impedances are resistive, not capacitive, which also results in treble loss, but in a different way. For some effects this can actually be desirable, for example the Fuzz Face can make sense to be used unbuffered. Anyway, as topo morto says, after any effects pedal (active, which almost all are), the impedance is decoupled, so using another buffer shouldnt make much difference.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 18.3 \t\t A fuzz pedal, when silicon v. germanium is brought up, almost always refers to a Fuzz Face circuit. This is an extremely simple circuit, with no input buffer, two transistors, a few capacitors and, I think, 5 resistors. Theres also to potentiometers. Silicon v. germanium in this refers to the type of transistors used. Germanium transistors pre-date silicon transistors, and in most respects are completely inferior to silicon. They vary widely in electrical properties, change properties as the temperature changes, leak (meaning current flows when theres no input signal), theyve got low gain and wretched slew rates (how well they change directions to follow the input wave). Theyre totally crappy for computing and high fidelity applications, which is why they are no longer manufactured and have been replaced by silicon. But in fuzz face circuits, they are magic. Germanium FFs have a really nice soft fuzziness to them thats really musical. By contrast, silicon FFs tend to be harsh and buzzy - kind of an ice pick in the forehead type of sound. There are a few models of silicon transistor that have a sufficently low gain to be a better fit in a fuzz face, but still dont sound as good as germanium transistors. However, as germanium transistors of the same model vary like crazy, a FF circuit has to be custom tailored to each pair of transistors used. In addition, the transistors have to be selected to be a good match for each other by measuring the gain of each transistor and pairing them up accordingly. Once the transistors are tested and matched up, the resistor values in the FF circuit need to be adjusted to match the specific gains of the transistors in order to get the best sound out of the stompbox.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 18.0 \t\t Theres a good article on this in ScreamInFX. To summarise the key points: Simply put, a buffer is a circuit that will exactly replicate what is connected to the input to the output and more importantly, be able to apply that output with no changes (be transparent) to the next guitar pedal in the line. ... So why would you want that, sounds like it does nothing? The hidden beauty of the buffer circuit is that it has a very high input impedance and a low output impedance. This means it can reproduce a signal from a non-ideal source or send it through a non-ideal load. ... When used correctly, a properly designed buffer pedal improves the high frequency response of your overall pedal chain. The main uses of a buffer pedal are: if you have a long cable; if you have a guitar pedal with a low input impedance or non-true bypass; or if you have a lot of pedals connected in series.\n",
            "\t [4] \t\t 17.8 \t\t This is hard to answer without details on the actual pedals, but here is my theory: 3pdt (foot)switches, like in true bypass pedals, have a reputation for being unreliable. If you are attempting a DIY repair on a pedal like this, thats where i would look first. In case the signal runs through a buffer when bypassed, check if the buffer circuit works properly, commonly a capacitor will dry up, or a bad solder joint will degrade over time.\n",
            "\t [5] \t\t 17.1 \t\t More electronics than music but try playing with some capacitors. In parallel with the load, these could dampen the high harmonics of the square wave and round off its edges. A variable capacitor would let you play with the effect. Youd need to judge yourself whether your existing circuit would tolerate this addition. Start with a small value capacitor and work up until either you get the sound you want or your circuit burns out.\n",
            "\t [6] \t\t 16.8 \t\t Generally buffer should reduce high frequency drop caused by long cables or many true bypass pedals by impedance change. Buffer does the job when no other pedal is on. There are some impedance sensitive pedals like specific fuzzes that will sound very different if plugged after buffer. Some people claim that also alter sound of their drive pedals but very little. Booster is also in this family even though it does not produce distortion itself. Try to use buffer after the boost. It could be the solution. You may also try another buffer, some of them are not transparent enough. Maybe your pedal is not germanium circuit but 13:25 is being talked also that not everything sounds good after a buffer\n",
            "\t [7] \t\t 15.9 \t\t The circuit isnt completely open. The cable acts as a capacitor (around 500 pF, depends on cable length and insulator properties), parallel to the input. That by itself wouldnt cause hum (it just “couples some ground into the input, but ground is quiet). However, for an unplugged cable the tip is exposed, thus you basically get another capacitor with a terminal to everything else in the room. In other words, the tip acts as an antenna that picks up electromagnetic waves. And if there are electrical appliances in the room, these will cause such waves in an audible frequency range. Fluorescent tubes, dimmed light bulbs and CRT monitors used to be particularly bad offenders creating buzz; nowadays a bigger problem tends to be the burst noise from switching power supplies. The solution is to avoid exposing the tip of the cable. E.g. plug it into a switched-off effect pedal; its metal housing will shield the tip from such interference. Make sure its a pedal in true-bypass mode, else it will actually connect the tip to some circuitry inside, which causes yet different outcomes. Alternatively, you can wrap first the tip in adhesive tape (as an insulator) and then the entire plug in aluminium foil. To ensure the foil has a good contact to the shaft, fixate it tightly with another layer of tape. If the noise sources are particularly strong, you might still hear some of it even with shielded tip, in particular if the cable is not so great. Instrument cables are coaxial, i.e. the ground “wire is really a wrapping around the signal wire that should shield it from all interference, but in practice this shielding isnt implemented perfectly so even then some noise might leach in.\n",
            "\t [8] \t\t 15.2 \t\t The first thing I would check would be the filter capacitors in the power supply of the amp. If Im not mistaken, these amps were made back in the sixties and often capacitors of that age require replacement, but it could also just be a defective solder connection in that same circuit causing the capacitor to be left out of the circuit. Any technician worth his salt can fix it for you in minutes.\n",

Bass strings are steel strings wrapped with copper. Treble strings are also steel and come in different diameters, but are not wrapped Piano strings are at much higher tension than most other instruments (around 160 pounds per string) hence the metal frame of a concert grand, which has to withstand around 30 tons of pressure, and close to 20 tons for an upright, for example, so steel is the only material used for the core of bass strings, or for the treble strings.\n",

            "\t [1] \t\t 24.4 \t\t I have to echo LROs answer: Absolutely nothing whatsoever Or rather, just dont worry about it. By not worrying about boy vs. girls toys, youll help shape her opinion that there isnt any such things. Toys are toys. Now, she may simply prefer toys that weve traditionally labeled as girl toys, but thats OK. It doesnt mean you cant keep introducing her to other options. Just dont feel bad when shes not into the same things you were maybe in to. As for Star Wars, perhaps shes just not into Star Wars. I have 2 boys and its not their thing, either. (As an aside, I think McDonalds needs to fix this with their happy meals. They always ask boy or girl making this giant assumption that theres this line between boy and girl toys.)\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.0 \t\t Boys ≠ girls When I had mine, one of the things I found really surprising (which with hindsight should have been obvious) is that girls and boys are not the same. I had always assumed tabula rasa, but this doesnt appear to hold water. My little girl will be happy for an hour playing imaginative games with talking ponies. When she gets together with friends they will stand around talking quietly about this and that. Sometimes they will try on dresses. This is not to say that boys cant play like girls and girls like boys, its just that for the most part they dont seem to want to. I will always encourage my little girl to be tough and brave, which she is, but given the choice between a pink pony and an Arduino robot, shell take the pony every time. Also children ≠ other children Also remember that regardless of gender, all children are different. My eldest son is not the least bit interested in electronics but loves chess. My middle son loves to cuddle and read, and loves taking laptops to pieces. My girl loves princesses and ponies, but also loves fighting and nerf. They all have preferences which are partially influenced by gender, but also seem to be mysteriously innate. Adapt your offering to the market There are ways to get your girl playing with boys toys, you just have to be clever about how you present them. Girl lego - is actually rather cool. Yes it has horses and princesses, but it also teaches about modular construction. We might build a castle together. Princess Leia - She has untapped force powers plus shes a princess (now we also have Rey). Girl Scratch - you can build anything in scratch, even a pony dress up game. Play apparatus - We have a bar in the hall that the kids swing on. We have Nerf wars. We go to the park. Present her with opportunities to develop physical and mental toughness. Remember she is a unique individual and will like what she likes. You cant force her to like something, but you can make learning fun for her by framing it cleverly.\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 23.8 \t\t I dont think your son is stereotyping so much as he is learning to classify. He has noticed there is a difference between girls and boys, and he knows hes a boy and that his mother and some of his friends are girls, and in his mind he is trying to figure out what that means. Rather than focusing on correcting his stereotypes, or trying to correct them with ideas that suggest there are no differences between genders, you should try turning the discussion to ways that boys and girls ARE different: Girls can grow up to be mommies and boys can grow up to be daddies. Girls have vulvas and boys have penises. When we go to McDonalds there is one bathroom for girls and one for boys. When boys are small they can go in the girls bathroom if they are with their mom, because their mom is a girl. But usually boys go in the boys bathroom. Youre right, a lot of girls do like dolls. Since Karen is a girl, lets ask her if she likes dolls. Youre right, a lot of girls like pink. Since Mom is a girl, lets ask her if she likes pink. Is that person a girl or a boy? What makes you think that? (Son lists characteristics he observes). I think youre right. Usually its boys who wear suits with ties. Plus he has whiskers! OR Hmm, yes girls usually wear longer hair than boys, but Im not sure that is a girl. What else do you notice? Understanding finer differences will come at a later age. In fact, a 3-year-old will often find it humorous if you suggest someone is a boy that does not fit in with his brains rule for what is a boy. I remember one of my kids coming home from pre-school at age 4 saying he wanted his friend Andrew to come to our house to play. I asked which Andrew (since there were 2 in his class), and he said, Andrew the girl! Of course, it was the Andrew with shoulder length curly hair instead of the Andrew with short hair like his own. So not to worry! Hes just practicing a new skill which is still a bit rough.\n",
            "\t [4] \t\t 23.3 \t\t I like Valkyries answer very much: show him counter-examples. I also agree with balanced mama, that his having concrete ideas about the differences between boys and girls is developmental. Id just add one more thing, looking at it from your sons point of view: Hes noticed that girls and boys are different, and more importantly, that they are treated -- unless youre living in a very enlightened area! -- differently by the adults around them. Ill bet someone recently and oh-so-helpfully told him what those differences are, and that this little bit of info seems to match what he sees around him, so hes incorporated it into his knowledge of the world. Girls play with dolls, Bella at the daycare is a girl; Bella plays with dolls. It holds up. He may even have gone further and incorporated it into his knowledge of himself. He is a boy; boys like trucks; he likes trucks. Yay! He has mastered the boy-girl difference. It fits in with what he sees of the world, and his world behaves in a way he can predict. Now you are telling him that not all girls like pink, or dolls, or flowers, and that some boys like pink, or dolls, or flowers and insisting he accept that. I bet he loves you very much and wants to believe what you are telling him, but you are contradicting what he has just learned of the world, and rejecting his newly learned categorizing skills, the ones that work! And you not replacing them with anything! No wonder hes resisting your insistance, and is probably more than a little confused. Children at that age like a black-and-white world; something either is a thing or it is not. What I would suggest is you validate his reasoning and reinforce his sense of identity without reinforcing western cultural stereotypes. Lots of girls do like to play with dolls, but not all, and some like to play with trucks as well. Lots of boys like to play with trucks, but not all. The people who make TV shows sometimes like to do it the easy way, so they show girls only doing things that most girls like, and boys only doing things that most boys like, because they dont want people who watch the show to be confused. The problem is that sometimes the children watching TV shows havent tried to play with both dolls and trucks and dont know how much fun both can be, so they think they only can play with the toys shown on the TV shows. But real people like all sorts of different things, and we want to let our friends play with the types of toys they want to play with. With my own child I would (and did) go further: He is a boy because he has boy parts, just like other boys, and he will grow up to be a man like his father. It doesnt matter whether he plays with dolls or trucks, he will always be a boy. (I would not mention trans-gendered people to a three-year old.) Girls are girls because they have girl parts, and will grow up to be women like his mother. (You may want to add here that girls and boys parts are private, and its rude to want to look at them.) I recognize that not every parent wants to open this can of worms when their child is so young, but I think most kids (especially if they are around babies being changed) have already noticed these differences. In a few years he will outgrow the need for a simple world where everything obeys rigid rules, and be open to the multitude of counter-examples you are showing him, but until then, if you base his boy-ness on his physical body, he may find it safe to play with girl toys, and to let girls play with boy toys. One more thing, if I may. There are plenty of TV shows that do not show the sexes behaving according to strict gendered stereotypes. (Caillou and Curious George spring to mind.) If the daycare must have TV on, can you have any impact on what shows are shown? Good luck!\n",
            "\t [5] \t\t 23.1 \t\t I have several boys and girls of wildly varying age. When we had our first child my wife and I thought that differences based on gender are all due to the environment, and that we would never let this happen to our children. Now, several children later, I laugh at this. One of the things that set my boys apart from my girls is that the girls consistently act responsibly at a much earlier age than the boys. A five year old girl realizing on her own its cold and she should get other clothes from the wardrobe seems a year or two younger than my girls started to deal with them on their own, but I could very well imagine this. Contrary to this, none of my boys were very well in this at the age of seven. In fact, they probably werent at nine or even ten. (OTOH, the child currently making the most fuzz about what to wear is my teenage boy. To him, this is at least as important as for his older sister. So this could improve.) I work hard at handing responsibilities for their life to my children as early as possible, and I let them do and decide things at an age where others just shake their heads about me. But this ultimately depends on the child, and there are huge differences between boys and girls, but also between different boys or girls. One child would make a train journey alone at the age of 8, another only at 11. One child stayed home alone with two younger siblings to care for at 14, another did that at 11. (Just to counter my own argument: the latter was a boy.) I left the decision when to turn off the light, stop reading, and go to sleep to some of my children at the age of 11, but I seriously doubt that I can do this with the child that is currently approaching this age. You see where this is going: No two children are alike. (In fact, I often say that the one thing that all of my children have in common is that they all have very different personalities.) I am all for encouraging children to be more responsible, but which decisions, tasks, etc. are left to them at what age is a highly individual decision that depends mostly on the child. So how do you actively encourage independence? I found that this starts very early, by not simply making decisions for a child, but involving it in the decision-making, explaining the reasons why you would decide the way you do, and being open for suggestions from the child. This absolutely includes letting the child make mistakes, even when they hurt a bit. (I dont see my task in preventing my children from every possible hurt, getting scratches and bruises. I see my task in preventing them from permanent harm. This has the advantage that my children know from experience that what I suggest is often what they should do, and thus follow my council voluntarily. In fact, the best way to end a discussion whether the warmer jacket should be worn to school is to say produce my arguments, and when they dont give in, to say I am fine with it, I said my piece, and they can do what they want. Left to their own device, they usually follow my advice.) If you try to always do this, then it comes rather natural (for both sides involved) to let the child have more and more influence on the decisions made when it gets older and acquires a firmer grip on how the world works. In your example this approach might involve talking with your son about what to wear (and why) every day. For me, theres many things that influence such a decision (whether, expected activities, whats currently in the laundry or should go there, and whatnot), so its rather complex for a child. However, constantly being involved in juggling those factors eventually teaches juggling. How long that takes, however... see above.\n",
            "\t [6] \t\t 22.4 \t\t My wife thought the same thing until we had a boy. While the range of enjoyment varies more within the sexes than across the sexes, in general, left to their own devices, girls will gravitate more towards traditional girl toys, and boys towards traditional boy toys. Girls can (and do) enjoy lego, but they dont gain satisfaction from spending hours of time alone building towers and space ships. Boys will play with dolls (okay action figures), but not to the extent that girls will play with Barbies. In our household, we base our decisions about what toys to buy based on what the kids actually play with when they get their hands on it. Most parents I know do pretty much the same thing. Most families have no time or energy to worry about the politically correct issue of the day. My daughter was considered a tom boy. She often preferred playing with the boys to the girls, and had a selection of both boy and girl toys. Later, my son inherited many of her toys. He plays much more with the trucks and transformer action toys than she ever did, and not at all with the girl toys that still survive. Disney has not been able to break into the aftermarket for boys nearly the way they have with girls, and its not for a lack of trying. Girls are eager to dress up as their favorite princess, but boys in general have no prolonged interest in dressing up as this or that pirate or prince. In the mid 2000s Disney commissioned an anthropologist to study the culture of boys. What they discovered was that boys, as a whole, have an entirely different type of culture than girls, within the same macro-culture. See Link Based on that research they had to invent a whole new marketing machine from scratch to reach the boys aftermarket. They went so far as too buy marvel comics and Lucasfilm (star wars). Yet they still have not been able to establish a solid aftermarket product that is particularly sought after by boys.\n",

Try your best to respect their decision because right now they probably need one person they can trust to just be themselves around. You mentioned that sometimes you get some new makeup and your child gets interested but then remembers that boys arent suppose to like makeup. So it seems like they want to get you to accept them as a boy, but they still actually like make up, but they tried to hide that even from you. As a part of the dysphoria, they might see girly things as lesser than boyish things, but I think it might be important to remind them that men can wear make up too, and not all of them are stereotypically gay (which also, nothing wrong with gay people) Your child can still like make up even though they want to be a boy, but if they change their mind in the future to being a girl that likes make up again, thats ok too. (I think its important to not shame them for changing their mind, theyre 13, and still learning) I think its important to let them at least explore themselves a little bit and make a decision. It seems theyre willing to wait until they are 18 to make any decisions about altering their body (hopefully they will get a job and pay for the treatment themselves if they truly want it), so they have time to learn and experience until then. Just be there and love them the best you can and let them know you love them. If you reject them and their identity right now, they might even close off to you because you just dont understand. Not only that, it might hurt them in a way like not even my parents love me for who I am.\n",
            "\t [8] \t\t 22.0 \t\t Why do boys love trains and cars so much? Biology. Science has discovered a link between hormones and toy preferences.

Plus, if your son insists on computer interaction, then go with LEGO Mindstorm (which lets him build a machine that must be programmed on the computer before it will run). You could limit his TV/computer use to only a set time every day. Does he have his own tv in his room? Remove it but let him watch tv in the living room. He should not sit in his room all day to goof off, but if you know hes doing creative work (like LEGO) that would be fine. (Incidentally, my 2yo son received some Lego Duplo (jumbo blocks) and we often play together - I may be 35 years older, but its still fun!)\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 17.3 \t\t Yes, you absolutely should Your boys are trying to share something valuable and important with you. I doubt youd be this worried about it if it wasnt digital - what would you do if they wanted to build lego with you? Or draw, or paint? This is the same thing. They want you involved in their activities. I view screen time as more of a necessary evil than anything else. My boys get 30 minutes each per day, and I would be happier if it were less. So wheres the harm in sharing that screen time with them? The interactions we have are not very high quality: occasionally sharing resources, sometimes planning together. You may get more out of it by bringing a more focused attitude to the game. When I multi with my two boys, I tend to do most of the building and working with the game mechanics - I construct a house, a farm, storage, crafting areas, etc, which the boys can then use when needed. It helps keep them more focused in a single area, and helps to inspire them to build their own creations. Im concerned about communicating that interacting over video games is quality human interaction. Both of my boys have their own COWs (Computers On Wheels), so when we multi in Minecraft we bring all our computers together into the same room and we can talk to one another directly. The game then becomes an activity were all enjoying together, rather than the medium of our interaction. So, this is basically a conflict between my understanding of whats best for my kids, and what they enjoy. How should I approach this? Should my priority be to push for my values, to do something that seems to be meaningful to them, or find some middle ground? So I go back to my original point - this is an activity they want to share with you. I doubt youd be this conflicted if they wanted to build with Lego with you, or draw, or play a sport. If you insist on only pushing your values, you discourage independence of thinking or action, and teach your kids that whats important to them doesnt matter to their parents. Plus, Minecraft is awesomely good fun.\n",

My middle son loves to cuddle and read, and loves taking laptops to pieces. My girl loves princesses and ponies, but also loves fighting and nerf. They all have preferences which are partially influenced by gender, but also seem to be mysteriously innate. Adapt your offering to the market There are ways to get your girl playing with boys toys, you just have to be clever about how you present them. Girl lego - is actually rather cool. Yes it has horses and princesses, but it also teaches about modular construction. We might build a castle together. Princess Leia - She has untapped force powers plus shes a princess (now we also have Rey). Girl Scratch - you can build anything in scratch, even a pony dress up game. Play apparatus - We have a bar in the hall that the kids swing on. We have Nerf wars. We go to the park. Present her with opportunities to develop physical and mental toughness. Remember she is a unique individual and will like what she likes. You cant force her to like something, but you can make learning fun for her by framing it cleverly.\n",
            "\t [4] \t\t 15.9 \t\t Now (2017) hobbyist electronics isnt really as popular. Kids are given programming opportunities via Scratch and similar apps on iPads. I would disagree with this premise. There is a certain uniqueness and pride to creating something physical which you can touch and show to people that you dont get from a screen - this applies not just electronics but to anything physical, box-karts made from scrap, creative systems (like Lego) that enable the easy construction of mechanical and static models, and traditional model building cutting out plastic parts to glue them together etc. An object which is subject to the environment, has physical properties which might make it behave in unpredictable ways, or does not offer a guarantee of success is always going to be engaging to an enquiring mind and useful in the wider world - IMHO a virtual or computer-based creations should be seen as addition to such activities and by no means a replacement. By way of example, my girls (aged 5 + 11) like to play with Lego as well as Minecraft etc. My 5-year-old loves nothing more than to create simple circuits using a Cambridge Brainbox Primary2 kit (like this one which features a fan which, if a circuit is correctly built, will take off and fly across the room. She can spend quite a long time going through the different options for switches and can do simple troubleshooting and experiment (like if the polarity on the motor is wrong then the fan will spin but fail to take off.) The experience she gets from this real-world activity is a world away from following instructions to copy something on a screen. Also electronics vs. programming is by no means an Either/Or situation - there is huge scope for the two worlds to collide. For example a build of Scratch exists for the low-cost Raspberry Pi platform (were talking hardware starting from $5) which enables Scratch applications to interface with the physical world through both input and output, and for the more advanced you can delve into more low-level programming via Arduino etc. The potential for entry into the field of robotics both for recreation and work is vastly greater than they were in our youth - as barriers to entry drop I can certainly see a future need for more customised/bespoke electronic devices than existed in our youth. The benefits are not even just about electronics, there is a growing shortage of people at graduate level with fine motor skills because people dont practice them as children (either through electronics / soldering or as art / crafting). I heard (on BBC R4, cant remember the exact show so I cant give you the source) a university lecturer had trouble getting students to train as surgeons because they simply lacked the motor skills necessary even though they were academically excellent. TL;DR - No, making and programming do not give the same benefits. Making (not necessarily electronics) trains the physical and fine motor skills which are always going to be very valuable throughout your daughters lifetime.\n",
            "\t [5] \t\t 15.6 \t\t Not all video games are bad per se, but playing them to the point of ignoring all other activities (addiction) is going to mean that the childs development and life experiences will suffer. The same problems can be seen with too much social media or texting. We countered this by planning ahead and arranging as many interesting/fun physical activities as the weather/surroundings would allow - cycling, climbing, hiking, soft play, football, swimming. Inviting their friends/same-aged-relatives along would reinforce the value of the activity. After expending a bunch of energy with the kids, it was actually useful for them to be able to play games quietly for a while so we could cook, clear up, do paperwork etc. There are a couple of caveats to this, though: 1) make sure the game-playing is done in the lounge - i.e. not the bedroom. Weve found that when children have games/DVD/computers in their bedrooms, the battle becomes about territory rather than the particular activity. If the game is portable, establish a rule that it must be played in the lounge. 2) be sure you know what theyre playing; games still need to be age-appropriate and not online. The single fathers I know have used this technique in combination with a daily routine to keep their childrens activities balanced.\n",
            "\t [6] \t\t 15.6 \t\t Your son is at an age where he should be exposed to as many things as possible, if you can at all afford it. Chess, Karate, powerlifting, legos, basketball, he may be interested in one today and another next month. Thats okay. This is how he will find out what he likes to do. Like I said, as long as its no strain on the family theres no harm. I will say, however, that playing video/computer games or watching tv is no hobby for a 10 year old. Computer Programming, however, is another matter entirely and is something worth exploring. The main thing to keep in mind is that the more constructive things he is exposed to, the better. Encourage whatever he is interested in, and show interest. Did you attend the scout meetings? This is crucial, because if a child senses parents just shoot them off to a different form of daycare, and arent encouraging them, they may lose interest even if they enjoy the activity. If the scouts rejected him (and you know this for a fact), this is correctable by addressing the pack leader or finding another pack, again if your son is actually interested.\n",
            "\t [7] \t\t 15.5 \t\t As other answers have suggested playing on the computer can be a hobby. However, you want him to be able interact socially. The good news is that there are a lot of social interactions to be formed online, and they can be lower pressure than being face to face. Now, you do need to worry about safety, especially since some people in the autism spectrum can be overly trusting, but I think constant communication with you is the best defense. As for a great place to get started? I would check out Scratch which is a programming language designed for children. The logic will appeal to his left brain, the pieces of code snap together like Legos (another great hobby, if not social) the creative nature will surely benefit him, and there is a great community which works to create some pretty amazing products. There are some other amazing resources online, and it is a great way to connect with people. Now, there is another aspect which is his physical requirements. You may need to push him slightly in order to get him to be active enough, I might recommend dropping the social part if that is too challenging and try hiking (by which I mean anything from a half a mile gentle slope to whatever he can handle). The nature is calming, so is not having to talk all the time, and he will learn a appreciation for nature. It may also help him maintain his calm. Other than that, if he shows an interest then let him pick it up. You can suggest options (sometimes he might not know what is avalible) but pushing too hard will not get you anywhere.\n",
            "\t [8] \t\t 15.4 \t\t Outdoor sports vs Gym training is not actually a one against the other. Many a times they are complementary to each other. Having said that, each has its own advantages which might be difficult to achieve in the other form. Advantages of outdoor sports: Most of the outdoor sports actively target the whole of your body than specific parts of your body. Outdoor sports which do not require specific equipment (eg football, volleyball, running) are way more easier to participate in than a gym workout (which might require weights in case of weight training and machines in case of machine training). Being close to the nature might keep you more motivated as compared to a closed environment of a gym (this is a personal choice though). Advantages of gym workouts: You can train specific muscles and improve the strength of those specific parts. This is especially beneficial for rehab scenarios. In case you are a beginner who is not too confident with your physical abilities, building strength is much easier in a gym where you have a much controlled setting. Machines for example help you develop a good form while doing certain movements. Weather proof. You need not worry about the weather being too hot or too cold outside. Unfortunately this is a reality that can prevent you from outdoor sports. My personal view: I do a bit of calisthenics (which doesnt require a gym and could be outdoors as well). I hike a lot which would in a way act as an outdoors sport and used to be a volleyball player in my younger days. What Ive realised is, my workouts in gym (calisthenics in this case) actually benefits my outdoor pursuits. And overall, both in different ways help you to stay fit and have an active lifestyle. EDIT: Based on the comment, how does one complement the other (some of the scenarios): Explosiveness. With outdoor activities like sprinting, you need explosive abilities. These can be trained in a gym. Muscle training for climbing - You can train for lat strength, biceps et al in gym which helps you in the actual outdoor sport. Running/hiking - Helps you to build overall stamina and endurance. This in turn feeds back to your abilities to improve your gym capacities. Swimming - this helps you with your breathing which is one key component for any physical activity (including gym activities). Some resources that can help you see how different activities benefit from gym activities: Gym activities for swimming. Gym activities for running.\n"
