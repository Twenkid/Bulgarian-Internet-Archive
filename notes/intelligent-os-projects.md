### Intelligent OS - controlling a desktop, PC intelligent agent etc.

19.8.2024
"Вседържец" (vsedurzhetz) means "God" in Bulgarian and an Operating System in Computer Bulgarian (Yunashki dialect, Smeatchobulgarski).
That's an old project of the Sacred Computer with unpublished work about it, a predecessor of it is the first "Smarty", then the Research Assistant, ACS which I use myself and have conceived and designed a lot of other functions which are not yet developed or integrated, one reason is the intention to do this automatically or semi-automatically by self-development.
However, either way it's supposed to happen when I focus on that part. "Smarty 2" had some dev.time and new functions, voice controlled LLMs and calling some commands on the PC etc., but not published yet.

Other project with explicit direction towards that:
